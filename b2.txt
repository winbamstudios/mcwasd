Will's Chapter: Chapter 1, Neon Genesis Evangelion (Not to be confused with Neon Genesis Evangelion)
In the beginning, there was nothing. It was about drive, it was about power. We stayed hungry, we devoured. In the air lingered a singular spirit. The spirit of former president Barack Hussein Obama II. In the beginning, Obama created time. He thought it was some pretty cool beans. Obama then created a giant blob of matter called the universe. He directly caused the Big Bang, violating the first law of energy and matter; ''Energy cannot be created nor destroyed.'' Obama violates the basic laws of physics, as always.
He sped up the time to something really fricking fast to create the S U N . Then he got bored of staring at a giant ball of gas for months at a time, so he created the planets. Earth was still a giant ball of flaming rock and beans so Obama made the First Really Big Flood(tm), not to be confused with the Second Really Big Flood(r) (y'know, the one with the noah and the boat). Anyways, he made Plants n' Stuff(tm) and created like a buncha other animals and stuff idk and also land and uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh "people" and Xi Jinping president of China and lastly also the uhhh Kim Jong-un for some reason. So, after all this making-stuff, Obama was really tired. He stole gabizillions of Bollywood movies from alternate timelines, inevitably creating the best Monty Python collection in the multiverse. And then he just watched all the Monty Python movies 50 billion times over and eventually humans learned how to do crap and stuff. Obama told Adam Sandler, the first human, that he needed a partner. So Obama made John Sandler, creating the first ever gay couple. Adam also really liked his Luigi from Super Mario hat so he just kept wearing it and then it became religious attire.

Emily's Chapter: Chapter 2, An Apple a Day Keeps Anyone Away if You Throw it Hard Enough
Several years after the creation of the universe, all was at peace-ish. Adam Sandler was wearing the best religious attire of all time and space,

a Luigi hat, until the breeze blew it off his head. And then the hat fell into a pit of acid. And got consumed by a diknosaur knwon as the Jucisaur (more on le Jucisaur on next chaptere). At this, Adam sobbed majestically and attempted to commit defenestration on the Jucisaur, but the Jucisaur telerportered away along with the bathroom it lived in. Nearby where teh hat disappeared, there was le THICKLE THACKLE. On le THICKLE THACKLE, there was a sneky with a top hat oh and also theres were applos that when you consumptionized them you would acquire knowledge of all the Minecraft lore SO ANYWAYS Adam yoinkity sploinkitied an applo and consumptionized it but then that summoned the country gnomes. The country gnomes are creatures that take your bones somewhere and theres a song for it whihc they sing all the time that goes like
''country gnomes take my bones to places
they dont belong"
also the country gnomes were rapidly approaching and singing their song at like 397 decibels also they were each carrying a Waluigi Launcher(tm) so that was kinda bad ig or somethin but just when Adam was about to get his kicked, Obama descended from the sky and gave each and every country gnome a new radio/record player/alexa/mp3 player/iPhone/tv to listen to their songs so the country gnomes left Adam alone and after that Obama said ''''ADAMDIDYOUCONSUMPTIONIZETHEMINECRAFTLOREAPPLES''''
''Uuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh maybe but the sneky told me too so i did'' ''''MYBOYTHATBENOTASNEKYBUTTHATSMYOTHERSONLUCIFER''''
''Oh okay but whys youre son a sneky'' ''''HECANSHAPESHIFT''''
Adam looked back at the THICKLE THACKLE and saw that there was no longer a sneky but an Obamist instead
''Hello my names Adam but you can call me the D!kkmaster''

''I'm not calling you th-''
''YOU CAN CALL ME THE D!kkmaster.''
''Okay fine you son of a .'' ''''''MYBOYDIDYOUJUSTCALLMEA''''''
''Uhhhh its not what it looks like-''
And that's how Lucifer got banished from Heaven because he inadvertently called Obama a .

Everett's Chapter 3, ??Popular Froot Looop Kathulu	??
Barack Okl BAllss was getting bored and slapped his brother with a tree (not to be	confused with
grass, the 100-foot tall mountain of green. Trees are 5 inch long tan-coloured and thin creatures who scamper around with great annoyance at	everything). His
brother greatly enjoyed it.
''Hello I am the GRASSssssssssssss, and I love to lick little Chilli- Feet(tm)(tm)'' Kim Jong-un	came
along and told The GRASSSSSS that it had to stay forever in what was now Nolth	Korea the
GRASSsssss came to it's senses and said:.:>.:.;;> Flick you-you little	monster<;:.:.<:.: I will now lick your Chilli-Feet(tm). The GRASSsssss proceded to lick his
Chilli-Feet(tm). Kim Jong-un then let the GRASSssssss lick his Chilli- Feet(tm) for several hours	after
their argumental argument. Barack Okl BALLss then rosted a few trees over an	open fire until they were black and white stuff was spewing out of their mouths. Barack Okl BALLss put the white liquid, called Cam in a cup which he
drank with vigor. He then	sucked on the roasted trees and went to the bathroom. The bathroom is a big pit of acid with a Jucisaur in it. The Jucisaur is the wisest and oldest creature in the EaRTh.
''WhY HeLLo ThERE YoU YOu ArE ThAtt PeRSoN WhO KeEps BoThErING MEEEeee'' the Jucisaur said. ''YoU MaKe MEEEEEeeeee CrYS''

''STOP THAT DANCING(tm)'' the Jucicsaur then started dancing and singing STOP THAT DANCING(tm) By Barrack Hussien Obama.
This epic dance-off lasted till 3 AM. At 3 AM Barack Hussein Obama, himself cames down to talk with "people" and instantly solve their problems.

"""TJ"""'s Chapter: Chapter 4, ''The Trees, they're back again!''
       Just before the Sillies started to attack, the Trees ruled over the realm now known as ''Georgia.'' They were peaceful creatures, though when they encountered Chilli-Feet(tm), they'd spare no life to lick them. The Trees had a happy life until one was born with a defect that made it aggressive unless it had Chilli-Feet(tm) to lick. This creature would reproduce and become known as the Silly. The Sillies were mortal enemies with the Trees, so much so that they even had a war, but for now, I'm gonna simplify it. The Sillies won and the Trees were banished from Georgia until much, much later. In 20,000 BC, the Trees came back to fight again. And this time, the Sillies could talk. They exclaimed, ''Oh no! (chapter 4 title)''
       The war had started up again, and it ended as soon as a great leader was born to stop the war.

Will's Chapter, Again: Chapter 5, The First Barack Obama (Content Warning)
In the year 1 AD, Barack Obama I was born. The three-and-a- quarter kings went to visit the newly-born Obama II-infused baby to bring him gifts and bless him. The 3.25th king decided to do despicable things to Obama I instead. Obama I grew up to be a great leader, founding a country known as the Original United States of America, or the OUSA. The other countries were mad that the OUSA contained their true god, so they just whipped out their Shrek Super Soakers and tied him to a big plus. Then they did Chinese water torture, but "people" worshipped Obama I still, and he lived on as the Obama Prism. JK! Obama I didnt murder yet, he suddenly reappeared as Obama 1.5 and preached the word of Obamna to the idiots who believed in garbage religions like uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Vistists and uh Serialkillerists and stuff.
Obama 1.5 re-founded the OUSA split them in da tribes and uh purged the weird stuff from Everett's chapter, ending the Chilli- Feet(tm) Apocalypse of 69 B.C. Anyway, Obama 1.5 made the uhm erm uhhhhh uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh water into wine alcoholic beverage so men and women could drink and drive and get

arrested for DUI. Long before Obamna I, however, there was Obamna -134342 from the year 75320 B.C. He made cool bean macaroni and stuff and I dunno

Everett's Chapter, Again: Chapter 6, We the NOT "people"
Mr Frankienstien was known for being, very... ummmm, very... uhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmm, he was an idiot. But this charming little guy had anger issues (he was also a son of a Tree and a human). The only thing was this gave him, more Brain Damage because he just kept slamming his head into the wall (SHAYDEN SOEST Take this as a warning to stop banging your head on tables). He spent half of his time delirious and the other time sleeping. This was a drug-induced sleep, as he also had insomnia. Mr. Frankienstien directly disobeyed OUSA and built a colony on the MMOOOONN(tm). He banded together with a GIANT group of NOT "people", (the "people" on the MMOOOONN(tm)) about 30, also because they are solo creatures. He named them NOT "people" because he is dumb. Anyway, he made the December of Indie Games, a document that went a little like this: ''We the NOT "people" declare that we will not be bossed around by a perfect Google!! country. Because I found these friendly NOT "people" who are my family.''. That is quite literally it, nothing more. He lived up there for a few centuries on the burnt trees he had brought. He had children with the race and named them the Semi- "people", I'm kidding he didn't name them, because he died in childbirth. The Semi-"people" were weird when they had babies, both "people" had a baby, making twins. Also, their heads got swollen and the babies came out of their eye (which is also their mouth). They have one arm, 2 fingers, 3 fingers from that finger, and 2 necks. They have gray skin, and black spikes in their mouth instead of teeth. And they suck human blood (and Burnt Trees (and Cam)). The Semi-"people" lived on the MMOOOONN(tm) for decades in peace, until a Sily was born among the Tree farms. The Silly reproduced with a Semi-Person, creating an Abomination (or a Thing as they are less commonly known). The Abomination was a sticky white eyeball and if you eat one you also become an Abomination. The Abominations roll around and when they open their eye at you you fall to the ground in a deep paralysis. This is how they feed on you, their eye opens up into a mouth which they eat you with. Anyways the Abominations took over the MMOOOONN(tm) after the Great Inhumaen War which lasted 3 days.

Sometime in the year 25 AD, gloink-like creatures called da MMOOOONN(tm) Goobers came to existence on you guessed it, DA MMOOOONN(tm). Oh, did I mention they were like gloinks? Yeah i did ok. Those thingies DESTROY anything and everything they come across, yes E V E R Y T H I N G. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Including shapes that are T O T A L L Y just poorly-drawn rocket ships. And even donut-shaped ones! Yum! Wait, a minute, why are all of the donut-shaped ones red and pi-

Will's Other Chapter: Chapter 8, Noah Gets The Nuke
Obamna (not obama 1 or 1.5) decided that the "people" of the OUSA were sinnin' too much, so he told this random sheepguy named Noah that he needed to get boat, put two of every animal (EXCEPT THE TREES AND THE SILLIES) onto a boat, with free Chilli-Feet(tm)(tm) available. So, Obama flooded the world. Then, Noah figured out how to construct a thermonuclear warhead with the spare Plutonium-239 he had on hand, deciding to nuke the ENTIRE FRICKING CONTINENT OF ANCIENT WAHFRICA. (wah wah wah) The remaining population of Walugi fish died out due to radiation poisoning and the general blast radius of a thermonuclear weapon. Strangely, in the Sea of Not Japan, Walugi fish were discovered with the radiation-proof gene ''SMG4'' or Super Microsievert-reversal Gene 4.'' These fish also were found with Intel Pentium 4 HT 630s implants upon their nasal cavities, and PCI Express
1.1 slots along their backs. Obama really liked Intel Pentium 4 HT 630s, so he spared them. They eventually died of the funny rock in space launched by THAT Germany.

From here on out, every Chapter that is a multiple of 8 will be LOST TO THE SANDS OF TIME AND SPACE, (They will be forgotten and go with Chapter 16)

Everett's THIRD Chapter: Chapter 9, Trees, Sillies, and ABOMINATIONS On the MMOOOOONN (Content Warning)
In the future we will have wars, wars, and more wars. And even more wars. The bininging of these was when the Abominations brought their slaves (Trees and Sillies) to earth because they were running low on Chilli-Feet(tm).
''! we are running low on our Chilli-Feet(tm), we can not supply our slaves!'' The Supreme Commander Leader Overlord Sovereign Monarch Potentate POMAGRANITE Lord Emperor Ruler God King of the Abominations exclaimed (Obama [[Hyperlink Blocked]]ing hated this guy). ''Um sir, we could always grab some from Earth, they just got Flooded, didn't they?'' The Second Leader Overlord Dutch-Man D!kkmaster (This title was in honour of Adam, The original D!kkmaster) offered.
''Of course, why didn't I think of such a Google!! Idea'' ''Because you suck''
''WHYHOEDAREYOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'' The
Supreme Commander Leader Overlord Sovereign Monarch Potentate POMAGRANITE Lord Emperor Ruler God King of the Abominations shouted with every fiber in his being, so much that Obama came down to tell him to stop shouting.

Emily's Other Chapter: Chapter 10, Short King Depression V.S The D!kkmaster (Content Warning, Again)
It was a nomral day is HAELL becaause Lucifer was doing ''iMpOrTAnT tHiNgS'' the overlords were committing mass murders and stuff and the sinners were either doing crime or each other. Until suddenly the (former) Supreeme Commander Leader Overlord Sovereign Monarch Potentate POMAGRANITE Lord Emperor Ruler God King of the Abominations suddenly spontaneously combusted into HAELL and a giant tidal wave of fishfrogs swept in. An astonishing glorious event like this obviously alerted Obama, so he sent Adam and John Sandler to investigate. But since John was too busy playing Tetris on his Electronika 60 Adam left by himself to see what happened in HAELL. When Adam got there he saw his one true emeny.
Lucifer Morningstar.
''OI YOU MOTHERER! I REMEMBER YOU YOU'RE THE  WHO WOULDNIT CALL ME BY MY ONE TRUE TITLE, THE
D!KKMASTER!'' Adam aggressively tap-danced over to Lucifer and tried hitting him in the face with his guitar but missed becasuse Lucifer is veery very very very very veyr very very veyrv vcery short
''hey thats rude'' Lucifer turned Adam into fried chicken for twenty seconds to subdue him while he flappy birded away ''NOOOOOOO I DONT WANA BE FRIED CHICKEN
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'' Adam screecheed as he got turned into a fried chciken
''to bad >:)''
Soon after that John rage quit Tetris and expldoed it from the multiverse and went to go help Adam but once he got therer the fishfrogs were alerted of his location so the tidal wave of the fishfrogs wnet to go do theri sumoniug chant adn they started chaanting in Furbese, the languagr of the Furbies and the fishfrogs summoned the most powerful being of all: Barney. Barney took out his ak-47 and headshot John. Obama noticed this and said ""YOUNEEDTORETREATUNLESSYOUPLANONVIOLENTLYDYINGHE HEHEHEHE""
Adam was pissed off at the fact that he would have to retreat but he did it anyway and returned with John to (whatever Heaven is called in the bibble two).
After they left, Barney approached Lucifer and said:

The rest of this chapter has been lost and is unable to be found. It is highly likely that the Sky Fae got their hands on it and are hiding it somewhere beyond the mystical veil that isolates them from reality.

Will's Minichapter: Chapter 11, Pokémon GO Revolution
Shortly after the events of the D!kkmaster War, Obama found out about a cool spagetti game called Pogaym- I MEAN Pokémon GO and decided to give the Trees access to it. However, strange events became apparent on the app. After the Treesilly Beta Test, the Abominations found out about Pokeyourmom GO, they noticed Chilli-Feet(tm) everywhere, but they liked chilifeet so they ignored it. Then Pokéµóñ GSAASTTY became glitch and shot and killed a ton of abomination. Teh Edn.
Mooni's First Chapter of Gay: Chapter 12, Creation of Lesbins
Lesbians were frolicking about. Lesbians were doing lesbian things and they were happy because they were lesbian. They were being watched by Trump. Trump is hiding in a bin. Trump likes bins. Trump is a freak. Trump is a freak of nature. The lesbians found him in the bin and because they don't like freaks they nuked him. They saved the bin and did stuff to the bin and taught the bins to ascend and be lesbian too. The newly lesbian bins had little bin babies because of reasons and procreation.
This is where lesbins come from.

Everett's FOURTH CHAPTER, LANDOFF OF THE ABOMINATION: Chapter 13
The Abominations had recovered from the stupifying blow of losing The Supreeme Commander Leader Overlord Sovereign Monarch Potentate POMAGRANITE Lord Emperor Ruler God King of the Abominations, the Abominations were bouncing back, literally. Using their	amazing tecknology to bounce themselves back to earth. Because of course if they were balls, why not be bouncy balls? Anyway, they used their super bouncy piston machines to glitch the supercomputer that is reality and send them to Earth in 0.00000000000000000000000000000001 zeptoseconds (way the  past the speed of light (The speed of light is 247 zeptoseconds per molecule, for reference)). In doing so they

slammed all the way through the earth's crust. When they did that they boinged out of the hole, coming across a tree, which they beat up. They then made themselves into Things, by going big using the Tree cam. With these new forms, they took a lot of Chilli-Feet(tm) from helpless Trees and Humans. These Abominations thought that Earth was pretty cool beans and decided to live there forever. They adapted, becoming a pile of cells able to make any form, but were susceptible to burning. The Things liked killing, killing, and more killing. And even more killing. They killed anything in the forest, and the forest became known as the Forest and no one went in it. Cuzz dey wud di. The Things made The Great Republic of Thingies which was a very weird civilazation. By weird I mean, they made their houses out of their dead ansestors, randomly attacked random things, screamed whenever eating, and scitter-scattered. Which is Thingeseian for scitter-scattered (hahahahahaha you will never know what it means!!!). To scitter-scatter, you must first become a Thing, then you pretty much have a seizure in front of everyone (it's a form of dancing). They held rituals to summon giant flying Megolodins (sometimes confused with Megolodons) which were a sentient form of shark that lived in volcanos in the forest. Where the Megolodins played Megalomania (this is also the name of their country).
''Human Yummmmmm....'' said one of the Thing councilors ''Human Go Away If We No Stop Eating....'' Said another ''But Human
YUmmmmMmmMMMMmMMMmMMMmMMmmmMmMmmmmmMMmM
mMmM....''
''They all BeeeeEEEeeeEEeE asleep forever.... If we no Stop Eating Then That Happenith....''
''Hman YMUYyy Ned Eta Nwo Plseasw...!''
''He Corrupting..., Whoops Simething Bda Hpaanes Nwo.... Mewais Cppuprign Nwolisthagin hono Immmi yayayyaidu..!'' Dark tendrals sprang from the 2 corrupt "people" and they majestically and gracefully exploded all of their internal organs all over the place. Oh, did I forget to tell u about the Corruption? some rando Thing came along and cursed us all to be Corrupt. As if the Things weren't already corrupt enough. Anyway the Abominable Things crawled out of the explosions and started unaliving a lot of humans. Abominable Things are Void-Born Things (the name was too boring so they just called themselves Abominable Things), which summon Megolodons, not their civilized cousins, the Megolodins. The Megolodons flopped around and caused a lot of panic and confusion, allowing the Abominable Thingies to escape.

"""TJ"""'s THIRD CHAPTER, Chapter 14: i bet
no one remembers the trees' plot
In the form of worship, the Trees didn't eat Chilli-Feet(tm) because they saved it for Obama. they only cared about Obama not even themselves, so by 18 A.D. they looked like absolute . they all kept Obama in a state of cleanliness and they always made sure Obama was fed. they loved Obama more than their own children gomn it.
Emily's THIRD Chapter, Chapter 15: The Great War of the Country Gnomes and City Elves
It was another normal day in New Orleans, Louisiana. Until the Country Gnomes appeared. The Country Gnomes are like Garden Gnomes but instead they have overalls and they're eating a piece of wheat oh and they have a sombrero for absolutely no reason at all except for WHY NOT. They sing their song which I'm sure everyone already knows quite well because it showed up earlier when they were about to beat the  off of Adam. So ANYWAYS the Country Gnomes were singing their song and aggressively tap-dancing after "people" trying to take their bones to places they don't belong. And as always, they each had a Waluigi Launcher(tm) that shot Waluigi rockets at their arch-nemesis: The City Elves. City Elves wear a loose t-shirt or hoodie that normally has like forty swears on it with baggy sweatpants or torn jeans and they also wear a turban everywhere they go. Their weapon of choice is a cellphone that summons Chili-Beavers which are somewhat like Chilli-Feet(tm) and the Chili-Beavers have kidney beans for teeth also they have guns but we dont talk about that. They also have their own song that rivals the power of the Country Gnomes' song. The song the City Elves has is ''I Want it That Way'' by the Backstreet Obamas but it sounds like it's being sang by Toad from one of those Super Murrio games or whatever. Anyways, the Country Gnomes were collecting bones at a steady rate until the City Elves showed up. A great, epic battle broke loose. The Country Gnomes shot their Waluigi Launchers(tm) valiantly. The City Elves sent their Chili- Beavers into the fight. This war seemed to rage on for eternities until a light in the darkness appeared: The Supreeme Commander Leader Overlord Sovereign Monarch Potentate POMAGRANITE Lord Emperor Ruler God King of the Abominations appeared. He told the Country Gnomes and City Elves that they needed to join forces with him to take over the Multiverse. The Country Gnomes and City Elves arranged a

peace treaty by arranging a marriage between their leaders: Demetres Demarcus Bartholomew James the Third Junior, the ruler of the City Elves, and Skuntle Bingoid the Magical Rock Star Lawn Gnome, the leader of the Country Gnomes.


Everett and Emily's Forgotten Chapter: Chapter 16, "The Jucisaur's Inheritance"

The Toad. The BUNNY WITH A BAZOOKA. The Country Gnomes. The City Elves. The Pig. The Sneky. The Abominable Things. Obama made them all, and another, The Abominable Snowplough. The Abominable Snowplough was mad. He ate the BUNNY WITH A BAZOOKA and said "Yummmmm...."
"Ah, ah, that hurt me a lot," BUNNY WITH A BAZOOKA said in a monotone voice. "I will now kill you with my BAZOOKA" (a BAZOOKA (pronounced like Toad) is basically a bazooka on steroids, see Abomination Tecknology (Bounce Cannons)). A Corrupt Thing (Void- Filled Thing/Abominable Thing) ate the eye of the Abominable Snowplough
"OOOOwwwWwWWwWwwwWwWWwWwWwWww" The Abominable Snowphough exclaimed.
"Ymuuuuyyy iths its HalhikhahahahKillkj...??!!!...!!!...!" The Void-born voiced with absolutely every emotion possible then crumpled to the ground and caught fire.
"Haha, that's what you get when you try to eat my eye!" He picked up the eye and put it back in its place, only exploding thirty times. The Abominable Thing got up and shook hands with the Abominable Snowplough.
"Good job?" Jucisaur appears

"Hello there! I was just in the bathroom dealing with Life Trama (Obama I deleting him in Chapter 5) when I heard some crazy  happening, I hope that wasn't you two committing twenty-five hundred million g3n0cid3s.

They fought through billions of countries, and eventually reached the promised land of Dairyland, Wisconsin. Sanic went fest up da montan to get the Fourteenth Commandment from Obama II.

TJ's Chaptererer, Chapter 19: how the f 

this story makes less and less sense the further it progresses. it's crazy how nonsensical and wacky and weird and goofy this story is. we are forming a religion based on this... this thing. and I don't think this has the potential to expand beyond this school, and I don't think this story will be able to be serious. this philosophy chapter is the only serious chapter in this whole story and I am realising now that this story is shaping into this whole project. this was only supposed to be a tiny, little joke and now, it's this.

This Chapter has been removed because it is now a part of Lore, just think of it, a Chapter that is actually legible, hidden away, that is

showing the Bible II: Electric Boogaloo, is more insane than you thought.

Everett's Chapter, Chapter 20: Dei

If you've read Chapter 16 then you may continue (I also would LOVE it if you had also read Chapter 19.)

So my story begins with a very, very, very, stoopid person, who tried to create an interdementia (I spelt it interdementia (instead of interdimensional), and I'm keeping it) portal. This was supposed to allow the human race to get ''infinite'' energy (It really didn't) so they experimented on the MMOOOONN(tm) (the stuff they released still got sent to Earth by the way) so nothing would affect Earth. They went exploring on the MMOOOONN(tm) to find a safe space to do it. On their way across the MMOOOONN(tm), they met an Evil Librarian (an Eviil (pronounced EE- Vill)) who was teaching the NOT "people" about false gods, such as Barbie, Ken, and worst of all, Dogman. He even taught them false prayers, such as The Barbie Theme Song, chanting Dogman. and even the normal Barney song (?? why the normal one? *cries*). They killed him and stuff for not teaching the true gods that you should worship: Barrack Hussien Obama, Camius Maximus, Barney, and The Abominable Snowplough. Somehow these are all the major gods that exist, Barrack Hussien Obama is the most powerful though. There is one more god that no one tells you about, and you're about to find out what this, this abomination is.... After killing the Eviil they marched on over to the spot for the experiment. They named this experiment project Crow's-Ant (My little brother said croissant wrong, and said Crow's-Ant so that's what I named it after) because they do. Anyway, they found the previously

selected experiment site and set it up. They had a glass sphere around the interdementia portal so nothing ''crazy weird'' could come out. After that Camius Maximus, himself, came down to tell them to turn the machine off.
''NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!'' Said A Very, Very, Very, Stoopid Person, ''I AM SHELFISH AND I ONLY CARE ABOUT MYSELF, ALSO I REALLY WANT THE MONEY THAT WOULD CUM WITH HAVING INFINITE ENERGY"
"So your a Shelfish " "Yes"
"well  you" They then proceeded to turn off the machine, but not before some Eviils came out and opened it further by chanting the correct barney theme song (Why, just why?). So then to combat the Malteleworm they were summoning, Aeliotians appeared doing that weird stereotypical Egyptian dance and chanting "Wikipedia," "Wikipedia," "Wikipedia." This countered the correct Barney theme song, by summoning power from the all-powerful Barney, who didn't like the stupid song humans had made about him ( them). They then blasted a very cartoony looking beam of concentrated "people" that exploded the portal in a GRB (Gamma Ray Burst (a big explosion explosion that explodes in two directions, kind of like a 2-way laser and obliterates everything in its path)). This explosion obliterated the head off of a Eviil and broke the spell.


Emily's Chapter, Chapter 21: The Lost Tribes
Once, far before the war of the Country Gnomes and City Elves, far before Da Sillies invaded, there lived five tribes in harmony. The City Elves, The Country Gnomes, The Forest Gremlins, The Earth Leprechauns, and The Sky Fae. All was at peace. The Country Gnomes brought the products of their land plots to trade to the other tribes, the Forest Gremlins taught everyone basic hunting skills and how to defend themselves, the Sky Fae were the keepers of the weather, the Earth Leprechauns were a signal of good luck and fortune, and The City Elves

contributed education and the knowledge of their advanced technology. However, this advanced technology was the reason the tribes were torn apart. The City Elves believed that due to their superior knowledge, they deserved to be the highest of the hierarchy they wanted to bring into play. The current leader at the time, Billy Bob Joe, stated that either the other tribes would submit to their rule or be wiped out in a g3n0cide. The Forest Gremlins said that they wanted to go back to their gremlin-like ways, until Billy Bob Joe, in his efforts to convince them to join his side, mixed up two different kinds of flowers, which the Forest Gremlins are VERY serious about, so Leroy Jenkins, the leader of the Forest Gremlins, said he would not submit. Leroy Jenkins asked the other tribes to assist him, but the Sky Fae decided they didn't give two s about what the  happened, so they just did exactly what God did in Hazbin Hotel and peaced out to get the milk. However, the Country Gnomes and the Earth Leprechauns declared that they would stay and fight. And then, war was waged. The war, now referred to as the Century-Long War, lasted, well, a century. The Earth Leprechauns were wiped out, but as their remains were absorbed into the ground, their spirits lived on there, continuing to grant luck to a select few, closest to the ground that they loved. The Forest Gremlins were forced into hiding, and the Country Gnomes remained to fight against the City Elves. Eventually Billy Bob Joe passed away through the battle to end all battles: The Great Hill of Why Are We Even Doing This Like This Is A Really Stupid Name George Why Does It Look Like You're Still Writing What I'm Saying I Thought We Agreed On The Name Mount Camium After Our God Camius Maximus What Are You Doing Give Me That You Bit-. The ruler of the County Gnomes, Rhoshandiatellyneshiaunneveshenk Koyaanisquatsiuth Williams, killed Billy Bob Joe, ending their war. Or so they thought... A week after the war ended, the City Elves launched a surprise attack on the Country Gnomes' town. The new leader was Demetres Demarcus Bartholomew James the Third Junior, and he came for revenge. He slaughtered Rhoshandiatellyneshiaunneveshenk Koyaanisquatsiuth Williams right in front of Rhoshandiatellyneshiaunneveshenk Koyaanisquatsiuth Williams' son, Skuntle Bingoid the Magical Rock Star Lawn Gnome. The funny thing was that Skuntle Bingoid the Magical Rock Star Lawn Gnome was only really upset by his mother dying because he couldn't lead his band

and be the leader of his Tribe at the same time, so he had to give up that field of work. Aside from that, he hated his mother so yeah the discontinuation of his band was literally the only reason Skuntle Bingoid the Magical Rock Star Lawn Gnome was upset. Oh yeah and I also forgot to mention that the Forest Gremlins were almost completely wiped out as well, but around five to fifteen of them retreated into the woods so meh that's not important lmao. Skuntle Bingoid the Magical Rock Star Lawn Gnome and Demetres Demarcus Bartholomew James the Third Junior waged war for hours. Insults were thrown, hands were also thrown, and there was only a little bit of gay tensio- wait what'd I say???? ANYWAYS Skuntle Bingoid the Magical Rock Star Lawn Gnome and Demetres Demarcus Bartholomew James the Third Junior, before the great war, used to be friends, and they met through the normal cliche friends to enemies to rivals to friends again to lovers trope goes: Their parents forced them to go to the meetings and  like that.

Will's Chap: Chapter 22, The Great Organ Harvest
Back on Earth, the hoomans were in the Dairy-Land, Wisconsin. The Hoo-Men ran out of Chili Dogs(tm) and they needed Fewd. However, they lacked the resources to purchase food, so they began stealing delectable kidneys from their friends. Hoo-Men kidneys contain a special tasty chemical called John's Flavoring Khemical (J.F.K.). JFK is also a primary ingredient in the well-known universal product, Chilli-Feet(tm)! "people" only wanted to steal one kidney so "people" could stay alive, but unfortunately, there was a major Alzheimer's Disease outbreak in Dairyland, giving EVERYONE dementia, causing half of them to die of Kidneylessness Syndrome.
Eventualyy the Hoo-Men got sick of kidneys and began the Great Lungliverinationinginizeration. "people" began eating lungs and livers and even SKIN to metabolize due to their heinous lack of resources. They kept eating organs. Alfter the public realized too many Hoo-Men were dying, they genetically modified Bean-Stalks to have the ability to grow ORGANS! "people" began growing esophaguses, urinary systems, brains, bones, and muscles! And also noodles. They really liked Skin

Spaghetti(tm). Skin Spaghetti(tm) was a variety of noodle comprised of C24H23N5O3 (Keratinocyte,) which was also an ingredient in Chilli- Feet(tm) for some reason. WHY DOES IT ALWAYS COME BACK TO Chilli-Feet(tm)???????? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Anyways, they stopped eating eachother and made BANK selling hoem groen or-gayns! "people" all around the world (especially Wahfricans (wah, wah, wah)) bought
them because they were broke and needed food so they bought crap tons of the Hoem Groen Or-Gayns. They loved them so much they all died.

In the Nintendont headquarters at Cleghorn, Wisconsin, a new plan was brewing. After the success of the Nintendont 63.178, they planned the development of their next big console. The Nintendont GayCube. A console all about men liking men. No heterosexuals here, just the same gender kissing. The only issue was that straight couples all around the world were infuriated by this decision, so thwy tried to kill REGGIE. But, they failed and GayCube development continued with the Brand Spankin'

New L.I.Z.A.R.D. (Lightly Internet-connected Zizzling Antimechanical Remodernized Device) running at 421 MHz. It ran Lousy Luigi Moonlight really well, alongside Cardboard Luigi: The Two-Thousand Month Windows, and even Luigi Truk: Quadruple Snail¡¡¡¡ After the success of the console, Nintendont had a new console brewing: The Nintendont Our with Our Spor- I mean Our Great Country Mother USSR!!!! Glory to the great Soviet Union! Obviously, people were mad. Communism in a capitalist country? BLASPHEMY!! The Our ended up being a commercial failure, living on as Nintendont's biggest mistake.

Also, every chapter needs Chili-Feet so uhhh Chili-Feet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alright, here's the real chapter. Back in DairyLand, Wisconsin, The Hoo- Men invented the world's first thing of Chili-Dog-Feet! Neato Dorito!
ChiliDogFeet (CDF) were a massive succeed, heavily boosting the economy of the Wisconsin and the OUSA! CDF spread all around the world, becoming a trillion-dollar industry! However, a problem was brewing. Straight men and women weren't buying CDF because it was "Too Gay." So the entire population of gays sued the straights and won, and they were cursed to like CDF FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!

Waldo's Cigarette: Chapter 25.95, "The End of the Beginning"
Somehow, the Bibblenet was growing. Everyone hasd a Commodoor 63, and they were hooking up their Diel Uhp Modems and connecting the BibbleNet bulletin board. "people" were holding Text-Church sessions over a 28K modem and talking to their friends. Everyone was talking about Obama, the Organ Harvest, and World War II (even though this was in 443 A.D.) Now, "people" were happy with their religion, however someone found out about the development of a new device. As soon as CD63 owners found out about the IBM-PC XT (wink wink,) they began going nuts over it. But there was one person that took advantage of a

CD63 cluster. JIMOTHY. (DUN DUN
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNN) Anyways, "people" built more Church/2s around the Wisconsin.

Will's Chappererer: Chapter 27, The Mighty Jimmy
Back in Dairy-Town is the false religionators. Their names were the Jimminianites or the Jims. All the jims worshipped a god known as Jimmy. The leaders of this religion, Master Shake and Meatwad, worshipped the Mighty Jimmy using the Bibble, which they insist is pronounced "Buy-bull" but it's actually "Bib-bull." The bibble Improvement Team and Meatwad (who is secretly Christian II) began questioning the Jims. Master Shake reportedly said "YOU QUESTION THE WORDS OF THE MIGHTY JIMMY?" when told it was pronounced "Bib-bull." More news at 7.


Will's Finale-ish: Chapter 28, The Employment of the I-XT
Remember the IXT from Chapter 25.96? Well, it's back, and the false god, Jimmy, has it. He stopped time. He created a hole of infinite gravity. He played Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0 for the IBM PC XT with CGA graphics. The Hoo-Men were done with the Jims' crap, so they grabbed a big shot gun and brutally murdered Jimmy, disproving the Jims. Jimmy proceeded to go straight to the deepest depths of HAELL. The Hoo-Men disinfected the IXT and then spread it into every home. Everyone in Dairyland had an IBM PC XT, and they did things. They also continued the Organ Harvest because this is still in ancient times for plot consistency??. HOWEVER, it wasn't over yet. Something bad was at hand. Jimothy was coming. (by the way, im leaving this plot point open for anyone to pick up the IXT story)

Everett's Chapter: Chapter 29, Chilli-Feet(tm)(tm): Origins
Chilli-Feet(tm), they're ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE but where do they begin, well then let me take you on an	amazing	adventure: In the beninging, there were the 4 Major Gods (and the ones from the previous world (see chapter 16)) Obama, Camius Maximus, The Abominable Snowplough, and Barney. Now Barney really wanted something good to eat so he had a son (all Gods are Weird and just reproduce that way, I'm not going into specifics) this son looked a lot like a foot-shaped slug, so he had another son (after killing the other abomination of nature). This son looked like congealed chilli. Barney LOVES congealed chilli. He named this son a Chili-Foot because he is dumb. Chilli-Feet(tm) are highly nutritious so nutritious that if you eat them you explode (even a Major God) so you have to lick the energy out of them. (cut to the present): We like to celebrate the Chilli-Feet(tm)(tm) with The Great Eatining, a festival where they feed Chilli-Feet(tm) to random D!kknosaurs so they explode.


Venus' Chapter: Chapter 30, THE [SpamPot(tm)] IS HEREEEE
ITS TIME TO  [[Spham-Pot(tm)]] motherer!! Obama threw  at a random guy 10,000 years ago and it caused BOOM! "people" began to worship [SpamPot(tm)]. The "people" that worship [SphamPot(tm)] are called the [Sphammish(tm)]. [Spamton] was the keeper of the [Sphampot(tm)] in the [SpamTemple(tm)]. They worship the [SphamPot(tm)] in the sacred [SphamTemple(tm)] in the hallowed ground of [SphamLin(tm)]. [SphamLin(tm)] is an amazing place where they hold festivals in the [SphamPot(tm)]'s honor every month so that [SpamPot(tm)] won't [LOG OUT OF THE SERVER] their family. The [Sphammish(tm)] use the [SphamSword(tm)] to fight their enemies the Sansians. One day the [SphamPot(tm)] ran out OH NO THEY CRYED WHAT WILL WE DO? And then Obama descended from the skies and gave them more [SpamPot(tm)]. Animatic was a guy who looked like he was a doodle on

paper and when he gets caffeine all hell breaks loose (THIS IS IMPORTANT REEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH). This happened
once before and oh dear god was it horrible.

Venus' Chapter AGAIN: Chapter 31, "The Battle Of Animatic With EXTRA Caffination (OH DEAR GOD)"
This is te account of te 2nd battle of animatic which [LOGGED MILLINS OF "people" OUT OF THE SEVER]. Now one day in [Spamuary] someone spilled coffee from their balcony and the joe fell directly on animatic and then the hell began. The coffee went into his mouth and he started glitching out and going insane and [exterminateing] some country gnomes, city elves and the [Spamlish]. Eventually there was almost no body left to oppose animatic and the remaining "people" prayed to Obama to help them and their prayers were answered and Obama descended from the skies and began to replenish their forces and they fought. The battle raged from The Spooky Before Christmas to the Raindance o f {N E X T Y E A R :3}. Then the savior of the land was born because Obamna went to get the milk after helping them replenish their forces. The savior was named Bingus McFluffermutter lll, he was born with god-like powers that {[ALMOST]} rivalled even that of Obamna's greatness. Bingus lead the army tat vanquashed animatic! Bingus McFluffermutter III was a hero in the Spamlish lore. If you ask of the days of yore, BIngus shall cometh upeth in the story.

Everett's ChapChapRealSmooth: Chapter 34, The Cause Of All Wars
You know that one Chapter where all of the factions of Tribes got in this big war with the City Elves? Well, the City Elves technology was powered by Chilli-Feet(tm), and the Abominations waged war on "people" because they ran out of Chilli-Feet(tm) on the MMOOOONN(tm), and most other wars have something to do with Chilli-Feet(tm). Anyway, the Chilli-feet(tm) are

called that because they LOVE feet, they love feet so much that they squirt their eggs into them (already fertilized). The babies eat the foot, as well as each other


Will's Chapter (Yes, Again): Chapter 35, "What is Love?"
Yep, were back to the Hoo-Men storyline. ANy way, the Hoo-Men were in DAIRYLand and they purchased Guac-O-Moley! Anyway, this brand new inventin was maed for the hoomen so they could now love eachother.
This was the first time ever the Hoo-Men felt ual attraction to other Hoo-Men and Hoowo-Men. This was cool! They could finally Re-Pro- Duce! The previously declining Hoo-Man population increased tenfold after the revolutionary Guac-O-Moley allowed the Hoo-Men to have
      . It was crazy. Before this, Obamna had to make all the Hoo-Men manually.


Everett's Howmanyofthesearewegoingtodo?: Chapter 36, The Forgotten Lost Tribes (weren't they already lost, how many adjectives that mean lost do we need?) Part I
You may recall Emily's Chapter from a very long time ago, but I assure you the City Elves and the Country Gnomes' story doesn't end there. The war started up again because the leader couple ran off and the new leaders declaired war. I'm talking about The Canabalistic Bats and The Organ Ants. Their song is "Sure the Canabalistic Bats eat your organ transplants but the Organ Ants shake your pants!" You may think it strange that these 2 Tribes share a song, and that's because they have a really close alliance, to the point that they can't survive without each other (and thier leaders, as Sir Pentious would say they "did a 

sssssssssssss"). The Organ Ants are blood-sucking, 6-inch ants (normal ants that someone streatched the texture of to make them 6-inches) ants that latch onto the skin underneath your pants, bite you 3 times (to get the poison in you) and start sucking your blood. So they live in Country Gnome territory, and The Country Gnomes let them stay there as long as they you know fight wars with them and support them. The Canabalistic Bats will just bite you and try to eat as much of you as possible, until you smack them with the 2 Tribes one weakness, a wooden paddle. The City Elves are extremely suseptable to them because they don't use wood, they build using Chilli-Feet(tm)ium. This means that the Organ Ants and the Cannabalistic Bats are immune to any attack that the City Elves could try to [[Permenently log them out of the Server (that is reality)]].


Lucas' Other Chapter: Chapter 37, "Da MMOOOONN(tm) WAR-ish"
WHENEVER THE THIS CHAPTER TAKES PLACE, Da
MMOOOONN(tm) Goobers decide they've had enough of Obama's bull
      . They go to war... ON DA MMOOOONN(tm). Yes, they make everyone randomly teleport to DA MMOOOONN(tm) to declare war. "How the  did we get here?" Everyone asked. "Look at dat MMOOOONN(tm) Goober!" Said the D!kkmaster. "S I L E N C E" Shouted DA MMOOOONN(tm) Goobers. Obama saw the weird-shaped MMOOOONN(tm) Goobers and thought "aw hek naw". Since Obama can do anything, he just teleported everyone back to what they were doing and left DA MMOOOONN(tm) Goobers to think, "Well ."

Everett's Howmanyofthesearewegoingtodo?: Chapter 36, The Forgotten Lost Tribes (weren't they already lost, how many adjectives that mean lost do we need?) Part II
So as you may know the Sky Fae have peaced out, and the Country Gnomes have been all like "we're bringing out our superweapons, the Cannablistc Bats and the Organ Ants against the primal enemy, The Space Squids and the City Elves" Pretty much everyone hates the City Elves and the Space Squids. The Space Squids rule the outre space and pretty much everyone hates them because they attempted to make war with the entirety of Earth. But the City Elves thought that they would be good allies so they allied themselves with them. So then, since the Cannablistsic Bats and the Sky Fae are enemies so, in order to fly high in the clouds (without being shot out of the sky), they had to make a treaty and scince everyone hates the Space Squids, the Sky Fae didn't just agree, but said they would shroud the area in a very, very, Very, Very, VERY, thick fog (this was helping them because they can navigate storm clouds).


Emily's Chapter: Chapter 39, "More Species" (why not)
During the war of the Country Gnomes and the City Elves, there was g i a n t	explosion because thats how most things come into existence in this book and after the giant explosion several "people" died BUT MORE SPECIES CAME INTO EXISTENCE. Even though we don't need any more! Yippee! Some of the new species that majestically faded into existence politely were The Soul-Badger Trolls, the Frog, the "Christians," the Barnians, the Large Chungulus, the Therians, the Neo Spacian Purple Basilisk, the Britains, and the Flammable Flapjacks.

Alex's Chapter: Chapter 40
It didn't happen

Will's Chap: Chapter 41, "Large Chungulus"
In the different town of Bluff Siding, Wisconsin, a new species was discovered. Yep. Any-wayS, this species was named "Big Chungus" with the scientific name of Magnus Crassus (Big Thick.) This species of thing was big and THICC. It even got it's own Commodoor 63 game (Chungus63)! So, the Wisconsininians thought it was cool and reproduced this FunnyBunny into eternity. Soon everyone has a pet Chungus. It was big. Really big. So massive. Thick. Large.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA i like writing. Writing crap fun. Me like writ. Write good. After they discovered the Chungus, they found out it had extreme jumping capabilities. Since the Wisconsininians wanted potatos, they got chungus to hop some of them so the could colonize Idaho, the land of the Potato. It took 100 treacherous days, but Wisconsin now had billions of potatos.


Lucas' Chapter: Chapter 42, Teh meaning of life and something only Will would understand

On this day, March 14, 1979, Obama decided to declare the number 42 the meaning of life for some reason. Why? Idk. Also President Jimmy Carter declared March 14th National Potato Chip Day because at the time 18 year old Barack Hussein Obama II requested that for some reason.

Everett's Howmanyofthesearewegoingtodo?: Chapter 36, The Forgotten Lost Tribes (weren't they already lost, how many adjectives that mean lost do we need?) Part III
This is where the war begins, the Organ Ants hopped on the Cannablistic Bats because if they went on the ground then they would have to negotiate another treaty with the Earth Leprecauns (who were the Organ Ant's worst enemy) and they were lazy so they just continued what they were doing and pretty much became the Navy SEALs and dive-bombed the Space Squids and started biting their many tentacles repeatedly. The Cannablistic Bats started dive-bombing the City Elves and tearing out their souls, along with their organs. The Country Gnomes came in and dominated the scene, taking all of the remaining bones and putting them where they don't belong.


Everett's Chapt-... ... ... ... ... -er: Chapter 43, The Soul Badger-Trolls
After the War of That Random Time When The Space Squids And The City Elves Teamed Up Against The Random "people" Of The Country And Some Random Animals And Insects, By The Way, George Don't Tell Them I Said That. So Let's Begin Typing The Name, Wait You Were Typing Everything I Was Saying?! DIE YOU LITTLE BIT- Wait You Already Sent The Name We Agreed On Online? Why Didn't You Say So? (She's Going To Freak When She Sees This ??), the Soul Badger-Trolls came out of that random explosion in chapter 39. The Soul Badger-Trolls came out of all of the killed City Elves and re-built the Tower-To-Space which is so tall that, even though it is only 5 meters in diameter, it is bigger than any other territory (all of the Lost Tribes take place on 69

Pegasis b, a Gas Giant in the constilation pegasis) in all of the Lost Tribes Lands. They only manafest when something is amiss.

Will's Wisconsin: Chapter 45, "The Mandela Catalogue II"
In another section of wisconsin, there was Mandela County. This dump had an issue with things known as "alternates," but if you want to figure out what those are, sit down, shut up, and watch the Mandela Catalogue on youtube. Anyways, some Dairylandianizers went to Mandela, and they though it was a normal place. They went to a Carbondioxidebnb and woke up to closet man. There was a weird lookin """guy""" in the closet, with a goofy ahh distorted face that looked something like this:


This crustymustydustyrustynotatalltrusty pile of discord moderator is what we in the "industry" call an "alternate." This guy proceeded to tell everyone in the house "information that is not desired to know" driving them MAD ;). This caused all of them to get funky and break it down on the dance floor with guns and then they killed themselves. It went like this: "funkyfunkyfunkyfunkypewpew" There was, as Michael Jackson would put it, "the bloodstains on the carpet." (smooth crimal) After this,

the alternate began fortnite default dancing over all the dead bodies with a "dun dun-dun-dun-dun-duun."

INTERMISSION: Home Depot
A place for dads to be dads We're daddin' all over the place
With tools and grills and grills and hammers And exhausted little kids who dad brings along But only once a month
Because that's when the court says Dad's allowed to see them (awwww.)

Everett's Merged Chapter: Chapter 46, WTF "Alternates" WHY???
So after the Massacre that was last chapter, the Soul Badger-Trolls flew on over and said, "Hey stinky!" in that one voice. This angered the "alternate" who began making them MAD. The Soul Badger-Trolls said "  you we're already dead" and re-directed the MADness back at the "alternate". Some more "alternates" got mad and attacked. The Soul Badger-Trolls attacked them back. The Soul Badger-Trolls posessed some "people", turning them into un"alternates" that were killing machines. Un"alternates" started wirling around in a t-pose, their body parts flinging everywhere. This was extremely effective, as everywhere the un"alternates" touched the "alternates" the "alternates" erupted into beeeeeeeees. And the beeeeeeeees looked something like this:


But wirling around like crazy. Then a Mr Notworthytoteachus came along and screamed at the horific scene, "No literature, no Literature, no literature, NO LITERATURE!!!" "AND EVEN WORSE, NO SCIENCE!!!" "JUST SOCIAL STUDIES AND MATH, MATH, THE WITCHCRAFTY LANGUAGE, ENGLISH IS BEST, BUT MEN ARE BETTER!!!" The Mr
Unworthytoteachus screamed, he then comited, genocide. HAHA thought I was going to say suicide, ha no, some "people" react differently to becoming MAD. And somehow through some unknown prosses that milions around the world are trying to find the answer to, he asked the unknown question everyone wants to know: can you taste the difference between butter and
Margarine? He also turned into a Dikknosaur. He also summoned Obama, who summoned the D!kkmaster, who summoned Lucifer, who summoned Charlie Morningstar, who summoned Alastor, The Radio Demon, he also summoned Husk, who summoned Sir Precious, who summoned The Barney Preists, who summoned the power of Barney to exterminate the "alternates". Obama hates Dikknosaurs, so he killed the former Mr Unworthytoteachus. The Soul Badger-Trolls went home.

Will's C????h?¯??a???p???? t???e????r????: Chapter 47, "Oh !@#$, They're Back"
The alternates decided to re-exist for some reason, with even a gasp FAKE OBAMNA! This was Blas-Femee! The "people" of Dairy County and Mandela County were done with the Alternates' bull and began pewpewing them with, not just an RPG, but a JAPANESE ROCKET PROPELLED GRENDADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was nuts. And theyn they realized that the JRPG wasn't powerful enough against a bunch of alternates holding Cathode Ray Tube Telly-Visionz. This was bad beans. The Hoo-Men of Wisconsin decided to call in the Wisconsin Defense Force (WDF.) The WDF had so many ing weapons, and they beat the everloving  out of the alternates. They still werent dead tho lol. ANY WAY, the WDF launched multiple mini-nukes, JRPGs, RPGs, Nokia 3310s, Green-Aids, bioweapons, Nintendo DS styluses, bricks, Cathode Tay Rube Tela-Visons, bombs, Ebolas, bacteria, the Tangi virus from that

one analog horror, chromebombs, firefox add-ons, FaceTime for Windowses, Interface Manager DR5s, iPhone 3GSs, pewpews, neofetches, "I use arch btw" mugs, win32 devkits, XBOXes, crocs, calendars, imrunningoutofideas, and lastly, school lunches. This was too much for the Alternates, and they succumbed to hypothermianiteyness. Their (maybe) last words were "We Are Farmers, bumbubumbumbum." This is what "people" thought was the last of the Alternates. But they might come back, because one type remains. The CEOs of Rizz. (to be continued in t????????????????h???¨¨??°?????????????????????e?????? ??? ????¨¨??????l???????????????o?¨??????????s??????????¨????????????t???????????????????? ???????c???????????????????? ????h?????¨¨????????????a????????????p??~??¯?? ?????t????~????????e??°??¨?????~??????????r????????? ???? 48)

We will now continue our regularly scheduled programming.

The Forbidden Chapter, Chapter 48: "The Alternative Return"
The CEOs of Rizz were ready to brutally murder the entire Hoo- Man population, but the WDF were ready, alongside the Idaho Murder Agent Association. (IMAA) The WDF and the IMAA fought back. Hard. The WDF destroyed and smashed the CEO's CathodeRayTubes, which were the source of their power, while the IMAA agents individually attempted to restrain the alternates. Once they were all down, they got back up again because the CathodeTayRubes of the Hoo-Men were giving them powah too.
So, the WDF quickly scrambled to smash the CTRs of Dairyland, Mandela and Cleghorn. After that, the IMAA restrained all of the

alternates again, holding guns to their faces, suicide style (i'm not going to censor it :D.) After the WDF and IMAA both had their guns pointed at them, they fired. The last of the Alternates had been terminated. The OUSA was at peace. Well, at least Wisconsin and Idaho were. The WDF and IMAA dissolved and formed into one organization, the Wisconsin-Idaho Protection Agency, or WIPA (wih-puh), which became the OUSA defense agency. This marked the end of the Alternative War.


Everett's cpppteer: Chapter 49, "this again?" Part I
Once the Soul Badger-Trolls were "Home" some random guy said "Wouldn't it be bad if some random guy would come in and destroy us all?" It happened. Someone made a bug in the universe that made "people" die if they existed. This led to several trillion "people" un-existing. That is sad, considering that only a few billion "people" previously existed. Obama restarted the server which made everyone normal. This caused a few bugs, but nothing Obama couldn't fix, or could he?

"Hello, I am your worst nightmare, I, The Enemy of Obama, Barney, will bring the weirdest place in existance to fight Daryland, that town is, Akniste" And so it was that the town of "Pizza Face" was born. He then brought the ancient Mayans in and made them Priests Under Barney (PUB). Akniste became a sprawling metropolis, with many pubs. Obama didn't like what Barney was doing, so he attacked, but Barney got his son, the Benetransworm, on his side. As well as the Abominable Snowplough, which was too powerful, even for Obama himself, he cursed himself for letting so many powerful beings exist. Barney rallied his forces and took over most of the world.

INTERMISSION: The PUB has taken over the world!!!

The PUB uses Wikipedian Magiak, which all of them got from Barney! They chant Wikipedia and do a cringe dance, the more cringe, the more powerful. EVERYONE HAS WIKIPEDIA MAGIAK, EVEN CITIZENS AND
THEY HAVE SO MUCH REGEN!!! Here are the ranks of the army:
1. The Assistors
a. At the back of the army, they are the weakest, they do that stereotypical Ancient Egyptian dance (







) and send energy up
to the Knights
2. The Knights
a. form a shield wall at the front of the army (
 but more on each side) with a hole in the centre of the shield where they stick their spears out (for the "people" putting their shields on the top it is the same) AND SHOOT OUT AN ARC OF ENERGY TO DESTROY THEIR VICTIMS THROUGH THE SPEAR
3. The Magiakians
a. This is the common "people", everyone before The Magiakians was below average Magiak power, with The Knights having NO Magiak power. These "people" dance and chant Wikipedia to summon random things to help the war effort
4. The Wiki-Wiki_Pedia
a. These "people" are at the above-average level of Magiak. They don't have to dance to summon things. They just point and say: "Wikipedia!"
5. The Wiki-Wizards
a. They don't have to dance OR say Wikipedia they just point
6. The Wikians
a. don't need any motion to summon things, are capable of feats that not even some of the gods can do
7. The Gatekee-WIKAPEDIA-ers

a. Bad at normal Wikipedia Magiak, but exells at Wiki-Rapp (summoning the king, the Benetransworm Wiki-Rapp is where they recite every single Wikipedia article (which are in the sacred books of Wiki-Wiki) from every single Wikipedia website in a minute, and not just the Titles, EVERY WORD
8. Wiki-Editors
a. like the name sigjusts, they edit things, but not Wikipedia articles anymore, now they edit reallity.
9. The Wikipedia Admin (General/THE ABOMINABLE SNOWPLOUGH (yes he got in on the action))
a. Since he is a god, he can do anything he wants (except go against the BENETRANSWORM)
10. THE BENETRANSWORM
a. The king of all of the PUB only able to appear when summoned. The most powerful being in existence.


The Laws For Anyone:
Thou shall NOT do SLAVERY
You will listen to your PREVIOUS leader, but ULTIMATELY to ME
If you DO any of these things, just keep in mind, HUMAN SACRIFICE is allowed .



REMISSION:
The PUB has tooken over most of the world, only leaving Mandela (who wants "alternates"?), Dairyland (who wants to invoke the wrath of Obama?), and the Lost Tribes (who wants to lose your General, The Abominable Snowplough because those are his grandchildren). Other than this, all of the world was tooken over by the PUB
FUNTERMISSION
Shayden's chapters are not lore important

Shayden's first Chapter: Chapter 52, "the second coming of the RATS"
In the end days, it is told that there will be a large ambush, where the grounds will have holes in then, and all the plants will turn to parmesan, this is the second coming of the RATS . this is not as funny as it sounds though, for the RATS are the size of your mom, and you know thats not good. These RATS are here to eat the ground that now looks like cheese, and if anything is on the ground will be destroyed before your dad can leave for the milk, so you better pray to...
...well I dont know who you can be saved
by...	... oh yeah, Obama, so you better pray to obama before you become prey for someone the size of yo mama.


Shayden's Second Chapter, Chapter 53, "rise of the pugs and cats"
DONT TRUST THE PUGS!!! They are siding with the cats, you may not know this but they're using their cuteness against you so you can let your guard down while they plan to take over. I have found out for myself, and it turns out they are almost done, they have been making a groomsday device that will control your minds and force you to pet them non-stop, and the reason they are doing this is because...	... well I dont know why, but I have been creating a theory that they are trying to keep you from praying to obama so you can't be saved from the-awww, sorry, im gonna stop writing for now because I just saw this cat and I wanna pet it, bye!


Everett's Chapter, Chapter 54, "WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ANIMALS!?!?"
The PUB was extremely confused when some RATS attacked and lost a few hundred "people" in the confusion, then one of the Wiki-Editors

banished the RATS from existance. Then some pugs attacked along with some cats, they couldn't mind control the PUB because the names sound too similar. But the cats still attacked, but couldn't get past the shield in the capital city, of Akniste before the Wikipedian Army put them back in their homes. The PUB all returned to their pubs (living quarters). "§úöé(r)

Shayden's Chapter, Chapter 55, "James, he's DUMB"
BEWERE OF JEFF, FOR HE IS DUMB, but really, he is D.U.M.B.,
Doing UR MOMS Balls, but for real, there is a group of RATS that call themselves UR MOM in order to fit in, its kinda sad that that works tho, but they call their chores "Balls" because they have all their plans in a magical ball, so beware of JEFF, for he is doing the chores of those RATS and helping them destroy the world.

Shayden's Chapter, Chapter 56, "Rise of the pugs and cats, PART 2"
I just found Out, that the cat that I started to pet had messed with my thoughts, I knew they were up to something. But other than that, I just found out that "UR MOM" is actually not the RATS, but its the pugs and cats that Jeff has been working for. I found this out when I looked at his name, it an acronym, J.E.F.F. actually stands for Just Everyones Furry Friend, which means he is working for animals, specifically the pugs and cats, so watch out for all of them, or else they wi- ooh, another cat, imma pet him, bye!

Shaydens chapter, chapter 60, the pug-and-cat takeover plan
After examining their plans a lot more, I have found out that they are only pretending to work with UR MOM, and the cats have been trying to

distract me and make me forget or lose track of all my work, but this time it wont work, because I Know what they were think- hey! Go away! Sorry, there was a cat, wait, thats not a cat, it has a tail longer than a jump rope! Now I can tell that they are not real cats, these are monsters, and now i can stay away from them easily without having to struggle, and now i know to keep everyone else away from them, so il talk to you if anything happens while i take them all down.

Will's Chapolitan: Chapter 61, "What Time Is It?"
Once upon a wisconsin, a Hoo-Man named Krambalamba asked his father what time it was. His father said, "Well, It's A Long Story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111". The FATHER then began saying that long long ago, in the Beginning of Time obama created time, and Glenn Quagmire. Quagmire isnt really important yet tho. Time began at 0 ABT, resetting at 0 BB (Before Barack) and 0 AD. As of now, it has been 242 years since the AD reset, so it is 242 AD. The date is Spamuary 47th, 242. Its been 1:43 since the beginning of the day, so it's 1:43 AM. GO BACK TO SLEEP! And then Krambalamba slept. FOREVER. And then he woke from the coma, said "Giggity" 1000000 times and then died. The End.

Lucas' C.H.A.P.T.E.R.: Chapter 63, Wikipedia should be allowed
First of all, WIKIPEDIA IS A VALID SOURCE IT CONTAINS USEFUL
INFORMATION AND IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. It also has a buncha
M E M E S.


Everett's Chap... ... ... ... ...TER, Chapter 58, More Information Part 2
So the Gatekeepers get about 25 years of training, ending in a test, the first year is memorizing the Book O' Wiki containing every Wikipedia and Wikipedia off-shoot article. Second year is learning every spell by reading the wiki-dictionary entry of every word in the spell (basicly telling it what you want it to do, but using the words' wiki-dictionary entries

Everett's Heli-Copter: Chapter 64, The Idaho Curse (shouldn't this be lost? 8x8=64) I #will
Idaho was very full of potato farmers and they had no time for worship, this angered their god, Camius Maximus. So he made their name come true, they were now all hoes, NETHERITE MINECRAFT HOES. THE MOST USELESS WASTE OF NETHERITE IN MINECRAFT, WHY DID
THEY EVEN ADD IT. So they changed their name to Idapotato, changing them all into potatos. The PUB doesn't conquor them because the curse would carry on to them, they would become the preists quite literally under Barney.


Shaydens chapter: chapter 65, cat fight
Ive been fighting the cats so they wont think of any plans to destroy us, and I think I just found a way to do that. Have you ever heard the phrase "curiosity killed the cat"? Well im using that and taking advantage. Im going to ask the cats, "Whats my name based on what im wearing" and they will die because of how curiouse they get, and they dont know that my name is actually jeff. See you after i kill them.

EVET's CHAP: CHAP 66, Conflict
The "alternates" crossed the border, they crossed the border between the PUB and Wisconsin. The Abominable Showplough will now attack. The Abominable Snowplough is of a special kind of god, they are a Rounian, a humaniod creature with extra long legs ending in 4 finger-like apendiges that support them. They have 2-5 tenticles coming out of their backs ending in 2 half cresent blades with what looks like the end of a sword.
They are unable to die eccept if they feel the extreme guilt of killing without a reason. It releases a highly poisonous hormone that instantly kills them, this is why he only deals with invasions and leaves his armys to do what they want.

Shaydens chapter: chapter 67, RIP

I am the wife of jeff, and i am here to tell you that he was killed by the cats, he asked them a question and they answered with "jeff" and that was the answer to the question, and his last words before he was BRUTALLY TORN APART LIMB BY LIMB *confetti goes everywhere* what he wanted me to tell you was that you should stay away from they cats(and pugs) (he wanted that to be emphisized) so after all that, i didnt really care about him tho, i just thought he was rich because of his gadgets that he made, but rest in peace and i hope he was chosen by Obama TO BECOME AN OBAMIST


Lost chapter: chapter 68, R.I.P. Jeff
R.I.P.

Everett's chapter: Chapter 69, The Attack
An "alternate" snekyed across the border, The Abmoinable Snowplough knew and he sent him back with a warning but began planning for a war.

Will's New Chapter: Chapter 70, "New Super Mexico Bros."
There is one safe haven in the heck of the world from the PUB. New Mexico is a state similar to Wisconsin, but it is REALLY HOT. The temperatures are OFF. THE. CHARTS. Anything related to wikipedia is blocked by the Great Wikipediaisnotareliablesource Firewall, created by some wikipedia hater.This prevents any and all Wikipedia from being used in New Mexico, effectively build a barrier against the pub.
HOWEVER, beer is plentiful here. Beer is shown to give extra power to "people" who drink it. That means that if you go to a bar, you can punch "people" and send them all the way to Idapotato. This is BAAAD. If the Pub uses the beer, they will invade. BUUUUUT, the Wisconsin Defense

Force was on the side of New Mexico. If the PUB attacked, that would mean they would be attacking Obama land.Also the WDF put up a bunch of analog security cameras on the border of wisconsin so they could execute PUB members with alternates because alternates can screw around with analog signals, meaning they could watch the border.


DISCLAMER: "alternates" are able to be killed by gatekeepers (from the PUB (though it takes longer)) and gods, such as the one that crossed the border.

REMEMBER: The Wisconsin Defense Force Has:
multiple mini-nukes, JRPGs, RPGs, Nokia 3310s, Green-Aids, bioweapons, Nintendo DS styluses, bricks, Cathode Tay Rube Tela- Visons, bombs, Ebolas, bacteria, the Tangi virus from that one analog horror, chromebombs, firefox add-ons, FaceTime for Windowses, Interface Manager DR5s, iPhone 3GSs, pewpews, neofetches, "I use arch btw" mugs, win32 devkits, XBOXes, crocs, calendars, imrunningoutofideas, and lastly, school lunches. (School lunches have the power of 1,000,000,000 thermonuclear bombs from Chapter 8) Also, Twitter is available on the Commodoor 63. I love hiding important info in random places

Everett's CCCCHHHHAAAAPPPPTTTTEEEERRRR:
Chapter 71, Here's where the action happens
So The Abominable Snowplough attacked. He was conquoring the Molkian Isls when he told them to retreat and attack the Wisconsin-New Mexico alliance. He made a big army and told them to attack. They attacked in the month of SPOOKY MONTHee with all they had. The Wisconsin Defence force gave all they had launching rally after rally of school lunches at the PUB. They were fighting for 18 days straight, 3 losses on the Wisconsin side and 0 on the PUB side. But about 3 mil "people" on the Wisconsin side were Wisconscious. Meaning that they

were Semi-Consious and incapable to fight. To be continued in Chapter 74.



Chapter 72, (Mooni's) Gay II: The Rise of Tim
If you haven't figured it out from the title, Tim is gay.
So gay in fact that the universe felt offended. Jesus & Harvey Sawyer were the only ones allowed to be this gay (Obama had given them direct permission). Why was Tim so gay?
Because they wanted to understand this rare phenomenon, they kidnapped Tim. Who's they? Gay. Everyone is gay but Tim was too gay. When Tim was brought to the bedroom/interrogation room, he revealed that he was not Tim, but Tom. Everyone was shocked.
He lived in London. No one was shocked because everyone who touches the UK is gay.
They asked him to demonstrate his gay. Tom in turn requested a flock of men be brought in so that he could "tame" them.
He did, and was let go. Tom remains a legend, a godlike figure amongst Minecraft servers. Obama tweeted about him.

Chapter 73, Emily's Chapter: The Cult of High- Pressure Washing Machine
After Tom was interrogayted, the Gay decided they would need to interview the head of The Cult of High Pressure Washing Machine, otherwise known as Bingus McFluffernutter III. They noticed that Bingus had the ability to instantly convert "people" to The Cult of High-Pressure Washing Machine. The Abominable Snowplough was the co-head of The Cult of High-Pressure Washing Machine, and the cult was a part of the PUB. Bingus McFluffernutter III was being interrogayted severely by the Gay, and just when all of The Cult of High-Pressure Washing Machine's secrets was about to be spilled, The Abominable Snowplough broke in and massively murdered all of the Gay that was interrogayting Bingus McFluffernutter III.

Will and Everett's Epic War Chapter, Chapter 74: "I Hate To Bring You In To This"
Remember Chapter 71? Yeah, the fight is BACK. The New Mexiconians heard the distress of the Wisconsininians, and quickly chungus'd to their rescue. They gave all of the unconscious Wisconsininians beer to wake them up and make them more powerful. The Wisconsininians were ready to fight. The New Mexiconians, Wisconsininians, and Alternates were ready to beat the ABSOLUTE CRAP out of the PUB members.
Unfortunately, there was an outburst of Wiki-Rap. Luckily, beer makes you immune to Wiki-Rap by preventing you from hearing sounds that fast. Sadly the Wiki-rap wasn't to make them weaker, but it was to summon their king, the BeneTransWorm who came in through a portal and anti- beered them all up. The Alternates still had their brute force, however.
They immediately moved to the head of the BeneTransWorm. Because there were 100,000 of them, they all mutilated their arms to snap it in half. Because there were SO MANY OF THEM, it nearly happened. But then it didn't. Obama decided enough was enough and snapped the BeneTransWorm in half, and then sent it to HAELL. This isn't the end, however. They knew they had won, so they didn't touch the Abominable Snowplough. He shall live. Then the BeneTransWorm opened a portal from HAELL and cursed everyone who was against them, they would anger the gods so many times that Obama would just snap them out of existance. Naturally this was a slow-moving curse, because he wanted them to suffer.

The Un-Cursening Saga begins HERE:

Will and Everett's Anti-Chapter, Chapter 75: "The Un-Cursening"
The Americans decided that they didn't want this curse, which angered the gods. So, they tried to commit mass suicide. WHOOPS! That angered the gods. After that, they tried using the WDF weapons on the portal to HAELL, which angered the gods. Anything they did angered the gods.

This was a big stinky for them, as angering the gods too much means infinite purgatory. They didn't want this, so they decided to make a wish. Because, you know, one guy named John had godparents. Fairy godparents. They had wands, wings, and floaty crowny things. If you know, you know ;). He wished for no anger gods, which angered the gods. After the wish, no one could anger the gods. Check back for more next week on FOPTV! Naturally it couldn't end this well, so they cursed them again, and a mysterious entity Stole John's fairies! OHMIGOSH!
Whelp, they stayed cursed in the end.

Will and Everett's Cµadter, Chapter 76: "Plan B"
Once Winsconsin won, they left the PUB in peace, which was a mistake. The PUB had a plan B, thta plan B involved luring the alternates into their territory and slaughtering them all. When they tried this plan, it worked like a charm! Now all of the alternates were dead (it took hours but it happened) and waited for Wisconsin's next move. Suprisingly Wisconsin was happy now that the alternates were gone and allied themselves with the PUB. The PUB accepted.

Will and Everett's Cinematicmasterpiece, Chapter 77: "We're Running Out Of Letters"
Unfortunately, New Mexico wasn't happy with the alliance and waged war on the both of them, this resulted in a crushing defeat for New Mexico which became shared land in New Wisconsin. Unfortunatly the curse had been undone and the god's punishment for making them so mad was to take away letters from the alphabet. Meanwhile Absnowmcfluffer was busy....

Will and Everett's Chappedlips, Chapter 78: "Here Goes Nothing"
New Wisconsin's south territory, previously New Mexico, was really angy. They HATED New Wisconsin's tyrannical rule. But, a rebellion was brewing in SNW (South New Wisconsin) with over 10 million members.
But, before they attacked the Wisconsin-Pub Alliance, they needed lots. They drank 10,000 gallons of beer, wine, and revived the Alternative Army. They were READY. PREPARED. Lastly, they all went to the secret church of Obama, prayed to obama, and began marching. They made it to wisconsin and attaced. The New WDF was completely unprepared for the power of the Rebellion Army, and immediately fleed. The Rebellion Army found all their hiding spots and brought all the PUB/WisconsinPUB members to their knees. They were all nearly killed, but suddenly, the Gatekeepers appeared. The preperations were too powerful, and the Gatekeepers were blasted away to Wahzkaban Prison, Waahfrica. This wasn't thhe end. The PUB lost control on Wisconsin, and everyone reverted to normal. This isn't the end, however. New Mexico seceded and became there own land again, and wisconsin was back to normal. For now.

Will and Everett's C, Chapter 79: "Why Are We Still Doing This?"
The PUB had retreated to South North (Snorth) America. The PUB tried to attack new mexico to no avail. The New Mexiconians had struck a deal with the WDF and had their own DF, NMDF², the defenders. They struck the PUBwith the 35th Alternative Army, with security again. They were READy FOR WAR!!!!!!!!!!!1 However, they still needed to prep. They gathered their army, alternates, weapons, and everything they had. They gathered Idaho, Wisconsin, and themselves together to beat up the PUB one last time.

Will and Everett's Thing, Chapter 80+81: "Wisconsin War I"
The Military National Defense Force (M.N.D.F.) began car-ing., alternateteleport-ing, and truckining. They beep beeped their way to the PUB, and grabbing ALL of their newfound weapons. They began ruthlessly using their multiple mini-nukes, JRPGs, RPGs, Nokia 3310s, Green-Aids, bioweapons, Nintendo DS styluses, bricks, Cathode Tay Rube Tela-Visons, bombs, Ebolas, bacteria, the Tangi virus from that one analog horror, chromebombs, firefox add-ons, FaceTime for Windowses, Interface Manager DR5s, iPhone 3GSs, pewpews, neofetches, "I use arch btw" mugs, win32 devkits, XBOXes, crocs, calendars, imrunningoutofideas, and lastly, school lunches, and also alternates.
They beat the PUB to heck and most of 'em died. Then, the remaining ones retreated to Canada.

Alex's Chaptererererer (real edition): Chapter 84, "WONDERHOY!!!"
Wonderhoy was a wonderhoy adjective. It was created by the wonderful EMU THE GREAT! It can be used in many ways, to describe many things. You can say stuff like "Thats not very WONDERHOY". THAT WAS YOUR CRASH COURSE ON THE USE OF THE WONDERFUL, WONDEREST, WONDERFULLY, WONDERFUL, WORD OF WONDERHOY! CREATED BY ME

Everett's Chapter (Emily can edit it): Chapter 85, Absnowmcfluffer
The ship name, Absnowmcfluffer refers to the 2 ""people"" who are in charge of the High-Pressure Washing Machine Cult, they have a thing for each other. If this wasn't obvious already, the ship is The Abominable Snowplough and Bingus McFluffernutter III. They are gay for each other. They do questionable things. They licked the same Chilli-Feet together and ended up kissing. This was a memorable moment in history, for it strengthened the Wisconsin-PUB alliance. Because Bingus

McFluffernutter is from Wisconsin so it's kind of like marrying off someone but by choice.



Shayden's kuru: chapter 86, KURU KURU

"""TJ"""'s Chaptertererterchap (Now done by Everett): Chapter 3 2, gay kissing Part II
The Abominable Snowplough and Bingus McFluffernutter III loved it so much they made it legal again. 3 seconds after they made it illegal.


Everett's Chapter, Chapter 87, Bonk
Sung Ligh was a very weird person, he loved the ho-men, he loved the ho-men so much he licked a chilli-feet. He then proceeded to Figure- 8Eat8 which is the act of mutilating your body until you are in a figure 8. He then Shipped Obama and Barney and they felt compelled to do hei's will. Bonk, Bonk, Booonk, Blonk, BONK is what they did, it ended up horribly, for it was never ment to be. Mc. Fluffernutter III seperated them permanently. He then proceded to honky-tonk.
       "Heay Yoouuuuoouuoouuoouuoullllkkohbbhk!!!" "MrBAERNY, the  are you doing!!!."
"Peometry, OHHHHHH,  You Mc. fluffernutter" "Sure hope You're not DOING anything, or anyone (Mc.

How to Convert to a High-Pressure Washing Machinian, by Emily: (THIS IS NOT A CHAPTER!)

Will's "GOOD" Chapter, Chapter 89: "WXYZ- TV"
The Hoo-Men of Wisconsin really enjoyed watching television. Their local channel, WXYZ-TV Channel 69 had all sorts of things on it. It had cartoons, weather, and news. It was typically just an uninteresting news channel. But, on the fateful day of Aghost 32nd, 563, a giant flippin' eclipse happened. There was a big black circle with light around it in the sky during the day. I know, CRAZY. Any one who looked at it had their eyes disappear because eclipse glasses didnt exist yet. This was horrible, becuse the whole newscrew was looking at it. They needed new eyes, so everything was messed up. The Alternates began running the news, giving better news than ever because of their insanely high intelligence and power. They also predicted the FuUuUuUtRe. It was great. WXYZ-TV began broadcasting all throughout the OUSA, and they even had a second channel called WIKI-TV for the PUB, now relegated to the land of Canada. They hated Canada, but they LOVED WIKI-TV. There was wikipedia, wiki-rap practice, and SO MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The

AlphaWiki Television Production Company, the owner of WXYZ-TV and WIKI-TV made BILLIONS!! BUUUUT, The CPUB (Canadian PUB) began abused WIKI-TV to practice their things, so they started brainwashng them with false wikirap and wikipedia articles, correcting the PUB and making the world peaceful.


Everett's Chapter of PURE EVIIIIIILLK, Chapter 90: PUIM
PUIM, Plad Underworld of Intelligance and Murder, were the survivors of the original PUB. Which got turned into a respectable country, the BLASPHEMY! They made the PUB normal again, just not as violent cuzz the fake wiki articles still took a toll. HUMAN SACRIFICE IS STILL ALLOWED. PUIM ran around



Shayden's twin chapter: chapter 91,	|| ?//
IIt all started with the Twin towers, they were both just standing there doing nothing, but on 9/11/2001, there was a plain that was hijacked by terrorists and it crashed into it, destroying all the work that was put into it, but there is more to this story, because the twin towers was destroyed for a reason. The twin towers is called that for a reason, not because theyre identical, but because TWIN is an acronym, Train, Work, Introduce, Nuke. this sounds made up, but I know, because on 8/28/2001 I gave a two weeks notice to them, and because of this I studied everything they did so I could write this chapter and destroy it the day after I quit. So by working there, I was able to find out that they were planning many things in those towers, because they were planning to nuke every state of america(exept for Ohio, they're built different) as you can tell from the name, so that is why I hijacked the plane and destroyed the tower, oh I forgot to tell you, its only one tower that they used futuristic machinery to make it look like its split in half. Why? Because they didnt need anyone knowing that they were able to interact with the people that were on the other side, and they

also made a barrier when they let people in so they couldnt see the plans they had. So there is a lot to this subject, and I dont know why I told you this because now I know the EOP(Eyes of Obama Program) is now on my tail.

Aaron's Chapter (Typed on Emily's computer): Chapter 92, The Blooper! Love Story
Blooper! is a very silly snow leopard plush who's secretly alive. Also, yes, the exclamation point is part of his name. One day, he fell in love with an insane clown named Rizzler. Rizzler was very silly too, and he loved Blooper! back. Except, they didn't know the other liked them back. One day, Rizzler decided to ask Blooper! on a date. Blooper! obviously said yes, and on the date they ended up going smoochy-smooch.

Emily's Chapter: Chapter 93, The Chapter About Literally Everything and Nothing at the Same Time But I Lose Confidence, Plot Points Switch Several Times, I Don't Stay on the Same Topic For More Than One Paragraph, and Probably Give Up Halfway Through Writing This Because My Title Will Probably End Up Longer Than My Work On the Chapter.
As you may rememememeber, the BeneTransWorm was snapped in half and sent to HAELL. You might also remember from like sixty chapters (who am i kidding you definitely dont loL) ago that Adam and Lucifer were beating the  out of each other there until Adam had to retreat back to (whatever Heaven is called in teh bibble two). Well, the BeneTransWorm appeared! Adn kinda like died lol so Lucifer's doing something about that ig. You also rmemebr The Lost Tribes, right? The Earth Leprechauns and The Forest Gremlins are unimportant to talk

about because I think I killed them off idk but The Sky Fae live uninterupted in... can you guess? THE SKY! WOW! So yeah and then The City Elves and Country Gnomes are now living in terror of what they will do next because both of their current leaders ran away together (Skuntle Bingoid the Magical Rock Star Lawn Gnome (Leader of The Country Gnomes) and Demetres Demarcus Bartholomew James the Third Junior (Leader of the City Elves)) and since they were both the last of their tribe's Royal Bloodline(tm), the tribes are panicking severely, leaderless, clueless, and defenseless from outside attacks! Yippee! Also, we can't forget some of the newer (cough cough 54 chapters ago cough cough) species! The Britains were just doing British things so we won't interfere if we value our existenses, The Flammable Flapjacks are very weak to fi- nevermind they're piles of ashes now. darn whoever made them really shouldn't have made them that flammable. Idk what The Therians were doing cause its not my job to write aboutut thetm. lol. The Neo Spacian Purple Basilisk was eating the souls of the innocent AND bagels! A happy compromise! The Barnians got kaboomed in the virus that Dooder Gaming released and Obama forgot to reset them (whoops) so theyre just in void or something. And the Frog was friends with The Neo Spacian Purple Basilisk and was eating newborns because it was too smol to eat children yet (dont worry youll get there someday Frog ??) and idc about the large chungulus+its already been talked about so... actually nvm. Large Chungulus gets shotgunned by a singular blade of grass. there we go. Also the cult in the same brotherhood as the High- Pressure Washing Machine Cult, The Taimu Mashin Kyodan (????????, Time Machine Cult) And the next topic is the most unavoidable of them all, and this isn't to be taken lightly, but it is: Bingus McFluffernutter
III. Lmao thsi isn't bad lol anyways Bingus has a (unfinished) character bio to yall that wanst to chekc it out. Click the link aboev. Amd npw, anotehr generic ad (thank my real-life brother for this)

Lucas' Chapter, Chapter 94: Da MMOOOON Goobers Strike Again (For the last time)
Ever since Da MMOOOON War never happened, Da MMOOOON Goobers have been pretty angy. So they decide they were going to steal Da MMOOOON. They did. The people noticed that the tides were different. They looked up and noticed Da MMOOOON was gone. So they flew up in a poorly-drawn rocketship to get Da MMOOOON back. There was no war. There was no violence. They just got Da MMOOOON back. It was too easy. Also Obama killed all of Da MMOOOON Goobers because he felt like it. But the D!kkmaster wasn't happy. I wonder why...

Will's Final Chapter: Chapter 95, "Return to Form"
Obama. Remember him? He hasn't had his own chapter in a while. When Obama found out that his gospel was almost done, he was weirded out. He thought, "Over 19000k words? Double it and give it to the next person!" His idea was to make a SEQUEL to the Bible II. While half of the Obamangels thought this was dumb, the other ones formed the Bible III/3 council. This wasn't nearly ready, however. See, we are still in the year 995 AD. There hasn't been enough history for the B3, so it's a problem.
Since this book ends in 1000, there were still 1024 extra years to cover. So, the B3 council decided to sleep until 2024, but accidentally woke up in 996. They just decided they would wait it out to write it. These Obamangels also happened to be the writers of this crap masterpiece. It took many, many (3) years, but Obama made the decision allowed some coverage in 1001-2024 for a the sequel to the sequel. Also, since there have been ZERO instances of the word "puzzle" before this, puzzle. :D

Will Chapter: Chapter 98, "The Forgotten Towns"
Long long ago, before the events of the PUB saga, there were 3 towns. Boring, Oregon, Unalaska, Alaska, and the most forbidden of them all, Gravity Falls, Oregon. Oh, I almost forgot the secret fourth one, Goobertown, Arkansas.
You see, within each of these towns lied a fragment of a yellow triangle guy. Except Goobertown. It has a special species native only to it known as the Goobers (Felis goobus), a special species of Cat. Back to the triangle guy. If you know anything about www.thisisnotawebsitedotcom.com, you're aware of Bill Cipher. Funny guy. ANyways, some idiot Hooman decided to take all three pieces and shove them together. This B-plot will brought up again, i swear. (CHECK BACK AT CHAPTER v'-1!!!!)

The (not) FINAL Chapter: Chapter 100, "The Finale"
Springfield, Kentucky (simpsons) was being nuked by arkasaas and it was kina badddddddddddddddd. so they devised a planto nuke to nuke the capital of arkanaas, Arkanaas, the City. This planto nuke would

explode the entire world if it was done improperly. A planto nuke would explode. when they stratigeticly dropped the planto nuke on the table, it exploded the word. Jk. It just came alive and turned people into trees like what was supposed to happen in Arkanaas, The City. Then it just turned off due to the plot convienance of The Protagonist, and the Semi- Protagonist. Because Plot Convienance. Then the SUAT came in and ate the planto nuke, ending the interplanetary Yugioh rush duel.

Then, a 'human' called 'usagi' came up with a b-plot
It doesn't change a thing, no matter how I slave away, it's all the same, I'm such a mediocre shame.
Think I'm about to break-
Come measure out my worth in numbers, Like I'm just another grade.
Look at my face and see this life I've come to hate. Throw me away, replace my everything-
I know, I know that I'm full of "abnormality", So I'll go and sew a new identity-!
Repeat, repeat, as I'm double-checking every piece of me, to see what needs to be changed-
Come look at my face, come and give me your praise, Erase my old name and throw it all away!
Metamorphosis takes just a couple of days,
I'll take off everything and be your one-and-only- Look at me on the stage, and see how I sway, How I step to the beat, tapping 1, 2, 3!
And no, I'm not on a string, I'm dancin' so free! I'm, I'm, I'm breaking!
"Normality"'s not enough to satisfy my needs, So I sold my soul for "abnormality"
I know, I know, that you think there's something wrong with me, But I've never felt so freely-
This butterfly left her petty feelings far behind,
And "Normal" had died a long, long time ago "Abnormal" life from a chrysalis of broken-minded love, I'll never ever get enough, so-

Come look at my face, come and give me your praise, Erase my old name and throw it all away!
Metamorphosis takes just a couple of days-
I'll take off everything and be your one-and-only. Look at me on the stage, and see how I sway How I step to the beat, tapping 1, 2, 3!
And no, I'm not on a string, I'm dancin' so free! I'm, I'm, I'm breaking!
Deep into the night, I looked in those eyes The mirror can't lie and so I asked it twice, "Who are you?", I whined,
"Who am I?" I cried-
But any shred of truth was thrown away with my mind I'm breaking, I'm breaking, I'm breaking...
And dancin', I sing,

'It's time to show my beautiful wings-!'

Come look at my face, come and give me your praise! Erase my old name and throw it all away!
Metamorphosis takes just a couple of days-
I'll take off everything and be your one-and-only! Look at me on the stage, and see how I sway How I step to the beat, tapping 1, 2, 3!

Now, it's time for WILL'S B-PLOT! There are going to be a lot of these. Back in our Obama-flavored cosmic bowl of melted ice cream, Mario and Luigi were very popular people. Savin' the princess, winning $1,000,000 haunted mansions, kidnapping the entire state of Pennsylvania, so on.
They wanted more than fame, so they decided to launch an app called Teek Took! It's like TikTok, but it injects you with estrogen! No Hormone replacement therapy needed! Just become more and more transgender as you slowly scroll your TeekTook feed (Keep in mind that the newest phone in 734AD wisconsin was the MePhone 3G!) TikTok didn't exist, only YouChoob Pants. {The MePhone 3GS wasn't released until 737AD.)

A while later, Mister Beast committed fraud. Many fraud! The people used Tweeter to do a weird thing called "CANCELLING". Ain't that neato dorito? You see, in 734, technology is heavily advanced! Instead of smartphones being invented in 2007, they were invented in the olden year of 733. Yeah. One year before this time. Also, analog TV gets discontinued in 934.

THUS BEGINS THE -0 thru -9 saga (-0 comes first timeline)

Will's PREEEQUEL: Chapter -0, "The Beginning??"
Before everything, before Obama, before it all, there was one thing. One. Before the spirits of today, there was the Spirit of the Preverse. The Preverse was a bubble in The Void directly next to the (at the time empty) Universe. The Preversial Spirit came from the Preverse, managed by the Gods. He seemed docile, but he believed his purpose was to cause chaos across universes. He decided to visit the Universe that this book takes place in, Fictional Universe ID#2391. Managed by the True Gods, who are "Will", "Everett", "Emily", "V", "Lucas", "Mooni", "Aaron" and now, "Luis". Unfortunately, MUID#0000 is placed directly next to 2391, or the Obamaverse, as some call it. (NO ONE DOES) As we slowly complete Chapter 100, Obama gains more and more power. Luckily for us, we

have time before he shows up. He has to go through 3 FUIDs before he reaches our universe. Currently, the ones we know of are in this order: first; Goiky. Next, the ACTUAL Family Guy universe, in 1999. Lastly, the Catelligence universe, or MUID#0002, where cats replace humans in the timeline. We only have 5 chapters until the epic faceoff that you've seen if you read Wisconsin War One. However, the PUIM caught wind of Obama's dimension travels and they decided that they needed to go to WAR to stop Obama from leaving their dimension.





Everett's Prequil: Chapter -1, "Part 1"
As Fictional Universe ID#6667 (or FUID#6667) was created (because Will was bored) he created obana (because he thought it would be fun to create a self aware entity) who ate the interdimensional portal and prevented Will from getting back get back, until the Prequil was created, so naturaly the Prequil was created, Obana gave himself a new name, Obama and the one world that should never have been created, FUID#2391 came into existance. Obana entered the universe at the same time as the preversal spirit. The Preversal Spirit could only imagine one thing had happened, 2391 was beconed forth into existance. Obama posed as the god of this strange world, but now t????????????????? ????????°???????????~?¨?????????¨?o?????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ????????? ???? ?????????~?????¨?????????????????¨¨??????¨?????????????????´???????o?? ????????????????????????????? ?????????????~???????~~????????????????~??????????????¨???°???´???¯?¨???°? ??????? ????????????????~???????????????~??????????~?????????~??~??? ??????????????????????¨??????°?????¨?~??????´?????´???°¨???~~????????~????????~¨?~???°??¨????????l?????????´???¨??¨°¨????°?¨??~??~?????????°?????????????????¨????????????????????????¯a??????? ?????? ??????? ??~????????????????????????? ?????????????????¨t??????¨?????????????????????????¯??????¯????????????´´????????????¨????????¯¯?¨????°???¨????????e?????? ????????????????~???? ~~????????????????????????????????~???¨???????´?¨?°?????????¨,??? ? ?????????????????????? ??????´?????¨????????¨¨???????~???¯~???¨????¨??¨¯???????????????????????~??????????? ????????????????? ????????????????????????????????~????n?????? ????~?? ?????????~????¨?¨?¨~???°??????????¨??°¯?¨?o?~?????????????w???????????????????????? ??????????????????? ??????~?? ???????????????~?????~?~?????????¨?????? ??????????~???????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????°?¨¯????????´?????????????°???¨??????????????¨??????h?????????????~????????????????????????????????????????????????????¨????????????¨????????e??????????????????? ???????????????? ??????????? ???????´???????~?????°???°?????¨¯???´?¨????????????'??????? ???????? ???????´??¨???¨´??¨???????????s???????~?? ??????????¨¨???????~??¨???????????????????¨?????°??°?¯?????????¨?¨???????~????´????´???????¯????? ??????~??????????~????~????????¨?????????¨°???¨?????h??????? ??????? ?~?? ?????????~??????????????????????????????????? ??????°?????e?? ???????????????????????????????~???????????????????~?°????????????¨????????r??????????????????????????????????????????????~?~??????¨??????????¨????????????????°?????????????????~??????????????????¨???????????¨??°??¨¨??e????????? ????¨?????????????????????????????????¯??¨?

Will's Ol' Chap: Chapter -2, "His Dimensional Travels, Part 1"
After Chapter -0 and -1, Obama began his journey to MUID#0000. First, he ended up in the dimension known by many BFDI fans as "Goiky", or FUID#2763. Obama ended up taking the form of a "Recommended Character", specifically as one of Ruby's siblings, "Poo". Not sure why. He began his trek through to the end of their universe, encountering many odd things along the way, such as Adobe Animate. Because BFDI is animated in Adobe Animate, he ended up finding many tools such as

"Paintbrush", "Line", and "Bone". He ended up using the Paintbrush tools and some keyframes to animated himself a rocket ship, eventually leaving FUID#2763.

Will's Ol' Chap: Chapter -3, "His Dimensional Travels, Part 2"
Continuing off of Chapter -2, Obama began venturing through another alternate dimension. He crashed his rocket into Cleveland's house, causing yet another bathtub gag. He was about to steal Brian Griffin's car before he encountered some pretty angry P.U.I.M. members. The PUIM decided they were done with Obama trying to gain godship in the Real Worlds, and visited Wisconsin to use the Hoo-Men's Computational Helicopter of Interdimension Location Initialization over Full-power Electricity-based E-teleportation Technology (C.H.I.L.I.F.E.E.T.), allowing them to access FUID#1999, or Quahog, Rhode Island. They began very quickly reciting Wiki-Rap to overcome Obama's weakened power in alternate dimensions. Obama was put into a coma, but the PUIM's leader said "According to the Wikipedia article on 'Coma', he should only be out for 14 days, or about 1 chapter. As long as we keep him away from the Griffins' house, as long as there are no sudden cuts to any locations near him over music, he should stay knocked out for a while." So the PUIM dragged him to the planet Mercury, which is too boring to be featured in a cutaway. However, after 14 days,

Will's Old Chap: Chapter -4, "His DImensional Travels, Part 3"
Obama woke back up and began using a Real Life Pencil(r) to draw himself a rocket again, and he managed to make it to the final universe between Him and MUID#0000, also known as the Real World.
Unfortunately for him, the Catelligence universe has a special defining trait. The Cats of MUID#0002 are far ahead of the universe in FUID#2391 and MUID#0000, and they detected him on first entry. They knew very well who he was, and they sent him to a godproof jail cell to be

interrogated. They asked who he was and his intents. He stated that "I just want to get to a nearby universe!" But the Cats were not so blind. They knew his intent to get to the one true world that actually exists in real life. They used their dimensional transporter to deport him back to FUID#2391, and it should have been over. But it isn't, like this book. It's never over.

  AND NOW THE FIRST 72 CHAPTERS OF THE BIBLE III

Will's First Chapter: Chapter 1, "Here We Go Again"
Happy new year! It's 1000, the start of the New Millenium! You remember Chapter 95, right? Anyways, while the original Bibblers are still writing the Bibble II, we now have the Bible III!!!!!!! Pretty neat, huh? Anyways, after the modern age stagnated in 935, the latest device from Pear Corp is the MePhone 4S, and they run on the 4G network. The tech age has evolved so much since the Bibble II left off that now spacetravel is possible without cults! Jk, people stull use the power of OBAMNA to use their
Chili-Feet powered rockets. As mentioned in the "Chili-Feet: Origins" chapter, Chili-Feet are made of PURE ENERGY. So, using the power of prayer, bronze, chili-feet, and Uranium-235, the people of Earth II decided to pay a visit to one of Jupiter's moons after a Chili-Feet monolith sent a spoopy signal there! This wasn't very Google!! for the Hoo-Men, however.

Will's Outdated One: Chapter 2, "1001: A Space Odyssey"
Their spaceship, the "Rediscovery Two" was getting through the asteroid belt, but their onboard computer, the "HALLNO 9499" seemed to be malfunctioning. It kept randomly turning on and off the ship's components. This wasn't Google!!. The ship members, Dave, Jimothy, Tim, and Miste
R. Beest. M.R. Beest was already dead because he committed unselfliving. The three began talking about dismantling HALLNO, but it could read lips. So, HALLNO killed Tim using a knife it had for some reason, and then Dave tried to get to the escape pod. But HALLNO said its line, "I'm sorry Dave, but I'm afraid I cannot do that", and then chopped his neck off using the door. So Jimothy removed HALLNO's Intel Core 2

Quad Q6600, and then used the other escape pod to return to Earth II. The lesson here, don't make artificial intelligence.

INTERMISSION
I made Chapter 2 before I watched 2001: A Space Odyssey. The following chapter is based on the true, canonical events of 2001. Enjoy.

Will's Great Remaster: Chapter 2.2, "1001: Anotha One"
In the year 1001, the Hoo-Men launched the Undiscovery One, the most revolutionary Dark Chili Matter spaceship ever. The mission was going well, with the onboard computer, HAL 9002 guiding the ever-powerful spaceship. However, when it experienced a malfunction in diagnosing the CHL-6960-FT communication unit's flaw, the non-hibernating crew members, Frankfurter Pooltable, or just Frank, and Davidson Shotgunman, or Dave. They conversed in Pod about killing HAL. He can read lips, and said NUH UH. After Dave and Frank went out in a pod for repairs, frank was forcibly yeeted into the Kuiper Belt. Dave asked HAL to open the pod bay doors.

Hal said: "I'm sorry, Dave, but I'm afraid I can't do that.

After Dave entered through the emergency airlock, he shutoff HAL, and accidentally had a seizure and noclipped into the Chililith orbiting Jupiter. To be continued in "1198: The Year We Kill Jimmy"

eat your shower curtain and shred your shoes. the S O U P was a culmination of complete and utter soup. no one knew if the S O U P was a kind soul or a wicked demon. all they knew was that federary 29th was a day to be wary of. eventually, in the year 1002, the S O U P finally arrived. the S O U P cooked bacon and baked cookies. everyone was terrified. however, Jimothy arrived for plot purposes and drop kicked the S O U P into the deepest darkest pits of HAELL, aka reddit. the S O U P had finally been dealth with. the people were safe. but one day, some believe that the S O U P will roam free once more, and will be even stronger than it was before. also our goddess kirishima romin has arrived to stop a dangerous evil.

They dicided that they HAD... to have concrete gutttats. However, it wasn't a unanimous vote, in fact, only one person thought they should have concrete guttats. Their name was YEL (the "L" is silent). YEL was very rebelious, as a lack of concrete made the pople of gitrl land feel. (Guttat is gitrlese for Chili-Feet) YEL was mad, YEL wanted vengance, for no reason. YEL WOULD RISE UP. YEL would become the giver of concrete Guttats. YEL WOULD---

LETTER OF THE NAME, NEVER!) (In gitrlland culture, the more letters in your name, the higher your position was) This was unprecidented, and all happened in the time of a month. With this newfound powder, YEL started the Concrete Guttat Crusade. The Concrete Guttat Crusade was a band consisting of Sung Ligh, YEL, Mr. Spidy-God, Mr Sonny-Sunny, Barney, and finally, The BeneTRANSworm. These powerful beings rampaged through the streets of Gitrlland, transforming every Guttat into a Concrete Guttat on sight. Then, the unthinkable happened, all of those PUB soldiers rallied at the call of the gods they thought were dead. Suddenly, the B3 and the B2 Technitions came back from the dead, not that they ever were, they were just banned from FUID#2391. The end.

Chapter 16: TeRi originz!
Once a pond of lime, Theresa was grown in a lab as a clone of a person.

Her first tests included having to ruthlessly slaughter one thousand two hundred seventy seven (eight hundred quid each) battle mechs. Theresa felt nothing. Until black oil got onto her dress. Then she got mad. So mad that she said something like "XARTDUJTYDQOATAGC GA BOAVDLDVDXBLICVCNJSSTQXFA YIBHK QDAUGKDXQIYHKQD" and
started a high school. It was an all girls school that taught battle tactics. The Valkyries (students) live in dorms. Some are in relationships, like kiana and mei, and some are other gay. Gay runs in kiana's bloodline. Her ancestor from 1500 married a former shrine maiden. Now you see, that ancestor, kallen, is related to kiana, yes? BUT Theresa's creator, otto "LiKeD" kallen. Kallen friendzoned him and married sakura, then kallen dies trying to protect a kid from a fleshy skinwalker. Sakura joined an organization called MOTH and died. Otto was sad and decided to make clones of kallen until there was one where kallen liked him while retaining all the awesome fighty fight kallen had. That never happened as you can see, but in short, theresa is kiana's aunt. That was stated. Got it? All right. I'll continue now.
Then for lunch one day, someone gave Theresa a magic calzone. Thereasa said " im kind of the embodiment of the sin of gluttony so how could i not eat this yummiy calzon??"
So Theresa ate the magic Calzone!!!
She magicakal girl transformrrmred into TeRiRi! YAAAAYYY!!!!!!!1111!!!

Will's The: SHIN 18, 1008: returnk to el past
The current year is 1019. Hoo-Men are unhappy with the current state of technology. Everything is flat, computers are lame, and the MePhone 11 just came out, shortly after the MePhone X/XS incident where hundreds of people got Pickled. (if ykyk). So, they decided to destroy all modern technology and create the MePhone E. So, that's a thing now. All hail chili feet

Skringle Skrongle and Googoo's wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 19: Continuation of Callzomnm/Excarnation of TeRiRi
TeRiRi ate the calzone.
Then she became a god (idk how probably the calzomnm or something just intuition)
She got fully automatic rifle x50 and the sirin x2,763. Oh and she also got admin over reality


Very Spooky Collab: Yummy 20, "The Gay Tape Collection"
As of 1019, Obama was chillin' in Haeven. Suddenly, he realized that he accidentally collected hundreds of tapes and created a Collection of Gay Tapes. Because he didn't really need or want them, he decided to drop them on Mandela. If you've forgotten, Mandela is home to the alternates. The alternates are specifically ANALOG-CONTROLLING. While they

were trying to watch Die Hard on Christmas, they realized that they messed up the tapes, a lot. They felt that they needed to develop their own non-magnetic storage medium. They called it the Floptical Disk, which they then stores all their sick tapes on.

Delanis, Chapter 21/intermissionish???, "woah im here now wonderhoy"
Hey hey im here now too!!!! Yabadabadoohoo!! Should i drop the mandela catalogue and the bible fanart?? That sounds like it'd be cool idk

LARG 21.910: yea sure
that sounds really cool

Will's Loredrop: Chapter 22: "Alternate: Origins"
In the year of 24,000,000 B.B. (before barack), in the location of what is now Mandela, Wisconsin was once the spot of a dimensional rift. This rift linked to FUID#0333, also known as The Mandela Catalogue. Since time moves differently there, it was the year 1999 (aka most normal time of the USA). Some Alternates decided to sneky through the rift while no one was looking, and reproduce. In fact, the Alternates invented TV! They full slammed underground to get the materials to build the world's first TV transmitter and CTR Tele-Visions in the year 23,999,999 BB. They also invented the BB gun before deciding to hibernate for the next about 23.9 million years and reproduce their technologies. Unfortunately, in 586, the Hoo-Men had already reinvented analog technology without the analog damage prevention circuitry. The alternates were unable to handle the

immense amounts of analog signal, and began to commit mass genocide in the streets of Mandela. Oh, and Obama shot False Gabriel several times in cold blood a couple thousand years ago.

Will's C: Chapter 22.5, "Alternatively, Racism"
In the year of 1021, the Hoo-Men and Alternates were living in complete and total peace. Tht is, until one of the alternates couldn't vote for Adam Murray to be the new president of the OUSA.. All the other ones got SO MAD that they stormed the Wcapitol (Capitol of Wisconsin) on January 6th, 1021 in rage, and accidentally overthrew the government. They overthrew it so hard that they accidentally revived False Gabriel, and starting SHOOTING anyone they saw who wasn't an alternate with their AR-15 Assault Rifles. This isn't a joke. 3,426 children were taken through their CTRs by Sir Discordmoderatorius Jimbob IV, also known as the Intruder or 6. Obama then came down and shot Gabriel 37 times in the chest, again because he just realllllly hates people named gabriel. During the reign of the Alternative Party, many things happened, such as Mount Rushmore's faces being replaced with those of Shadow the Hedgehog. School exams were replaced with fanfic writings, and anyone even slightly related to the USDTP was brutally executed in front of every Alternate. It was bad. Suddenly, the Alternate Alternates appeared! They overthrew the government again, and reinstated the normal one. All was well, until a new local church popped up nearby...

Reminder: It's about 1019 now, which is also 2019.

INTERMISSION: A Beauty of the Skies
On February 23rd, 1973, at approximately 11:42 PM, there was a Meteor Shower in Last Chance, Idapotato. This was the first meteor shower Hardcore County has experienced since 1923! Even better, these meteors were comprised of CHEESE! They even had some fragments of "Chili-Feet" in them!!!!

The Chili-Feet are not CORRUPTED. LICK THEM IT IS WORTH THE RISK

Delanis' first actual chapter: Ze Chapter 23: "unchurch
"

Sandrone's chapter 24: "about gimbal lock" (and more)
GIMBAL LOCK
Gimbal lock occurs when the outer gimbal axis is carried around by vehicle motion to be parallel to the inner gimbal axis. At this trivial point the three gimbal axes lie in a single plane. No gimbal freedom now exists to "unwind" base motion about an axis normal to this plane. The gimbal lock problem arises because the axes of rotation aren't realigned to the

aircraft after each rotation.Coordinate singularities and gimbal lock are two phenomena that present themselves in models for the dynamics of mechanical systems. The former phenomenon pertains to the coordinates used to parameterize the configuration manifold of the system, while the latter phenomenon has a distinctive physical manifestation. A well-known gimbal lock incident happened in the Apollo 11 Moon mission. On this spacecraft, a set of gimbals was used on an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The engineers were aware of the gimbal lock problem but had declined to use a fourth gimbal. The singularity of yaw pitch roll always occurs when the middle angle takes on a particular value, and for roll/pitch /yaw angles the pitch angle is equal to pi/2, leads to the singularity condition. This condition is also known by the rather unusual name of gimbal lock. If you've ever seen the movie Apollo 13 you will have heard that term used. The flaw is that Euler angles have a problem known as the gimbal lock that prevents specific rotations when two axes align. To recover from gimbal lock the user has to go around the zenith - explicitly: reduce the elevation, change the azimuth to match the azimuth of the target, then change the elevation to match the target.

MACHS AND THE SOUND BARRIER
Supersonic speed is the speed of an object that exceeds the speed of sound (Mach 1). For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) at sea level, this speed is approximately 343.2 m/s (1,126 ft/s; 768 mph; 667.1 kn; 1,236 km/h). Mach 1 is the speed of sound, Mach 2 is twice the speed of sound, and Mach 3 is three times the speed of sound. The highest speed ejection ever recorded was at 1300 miles per hour, which is superseded by the Darkstar (from Top Gun Maverick) by a huge margin of 6700 miles per hour. Hitting Mach 10 speeds at sea level will eventually smash the organs and skeleton of the pilot, turning the human body into a bag of soup. The highest mach speed achieved by a jet-

powered aircraft is Mach 9.6, set by NASA's X-43A. The X-43A's record- breaking flight was in November 2004.

OOPS
We shut down the arc. Whoopsies!

Will's Chapter, Chapter 25: "Channel D.D.D."
The year is 1093. No one died, except the Chili-Hands invasion of 1086 which caused them to die. Oh, and the Moonvasion of 1044. Either way, we're not on Earth right now. We're on Planet Popstar, the home of Kirby! Earth is currently at the dry cleaners for a year, we live in a giant sphere plugging the hole in Planet Popstar.
Unfortunately, some DIMWIT decided to open the Sphere Door and let the Wi-Fi out. This drove everyone nearly insane because Popstar uses their own TV protocol called Universal Remote Mother on Msupernintendo, or URMOM. The only reason it was created was because Meta Knight was a really big EarthBound fan. I kid you not. Well, the sillies on V11 were using SECAM, which is french and really really bad. So, they had to buy USGD$9999 URMOM2SECAM converter boxes. But, one guy who owned a really big Satellite Dish hijacked the Distributed Digital Dededelevision satellites and started ONLY broadcasting Dedede saying "I AM A SUPAH STAH WARRIAH" on SECAM. Then, the NTSC and PAL60 ninjas kidnapped Mr. Sécam and replaced everyone's TV stations with ATSC, which is digital. Then, the VCR ninjas kidnapped Mr. Atseech and replaced it with NTSC, where it remained. Then, Channel DDD decided to hijack the Universal Communications Commission to ban NTSC, and then they created N.E.S.S., New Earthbound Super Stahwarrior TV Network. Meta Knight really likes EarthBound. Did I mention EarthBound? Oh yeah, almost

forgot to mention EarthBound. Did I mention EarthBound, DID I? Anyways, The V11ers formed the Silly Corporation which overthrew NESS with LUCAS, or Low Usage Computerized Analog System. Oh yeah, did I mention Mother 3? I don't think I did. That lasted, until people got mad that they needed more converter boxes, so they overthrew it again with PAL, which then got overthrown again with NINTEN, or New Internet Nintendo Technologies Entertainment Network! Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention Mother 1/EarthBound Beginnings. Finally, it got overthrown one more time with PAL60. Until it got overthrown again and replaced with LUCAS once and for all.

AT LEAST UNTIL IT GOT OVERTHROWN YET AGAIN AND REPLACED WITH LUCASNESSNINTENATSCNTSCPAL60PALSECAMURMOM, THE ULTIMATE UNIVERSAL STANDARD.
Channel DDD is still available on URMOM as UDDD.



THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN
Of ultimate destiny


Collective Chapter 26: "Why TeRiRi decided to 1v1 obama"
TeRiRi saw all the oppression and saw that it was Google!!. And- JUST KIDDING IT WASN'T AND TERIRI DIDN'T THINK THAT, I JUST WANTED TO QUOTE THE JEBUS BOOK.
So Obama and TeRi began to fight.

TeRiRi commits new god.
Its nice to have obama dead and gone.

TeRiRi found it quite difficult to reverse the reality edits obama had made. But slowly, teriri restored the universe to its original state.
But.. it wasn't Google!! enough..
Chapter 30: "Perfume Lady Forensic Analyst" EMILIE????!!!>???



Chapter 31: "?????????????"
The banana mystery is still a mystery. Well, that's what Emilie thought.
The banana mystery is not a mystery.
The banana mystery is a mysterious mystery of a mysterious non- mystery.

Wait you know how after you say something too much it doesnt sound like a word

Part one: The Autopsy
Esteemed doctors Mihkali Varshovski and Gregory House were currently looking at the victim's right foot.

"Sole of foot. Bullet hole, No exit wound."
"Should we locate the bullet?" Mikhali questioned.
"Yes," House replied. "Do you want to do it the old fashioned way, or the modern technology way?"
"Well the new way is kind of boring.." "And the dude is already dead.."
"And he doesn't have anyone to mourn him" "So"
They smile mischievously "Scalpel?"
"Yep. here"
House hands Varshavski the scalpel.
The scalpel grazes the deceased's lower leg. One millimetre
Two millimetres Three.
"Three-point-four millimetres." House writes that down.
Varshovski makes a grandiose stroke with the blade.
The incision spans from eight centimetres above the ankle, to six centimetres below the knee.
The actual incision is eighteen centimetres long. "Are you even measuring the cut??"
"Nope. Measuring is for losers." "You're a loser :skull:"
"Shut up or i'm gonna make this look almost as ugly as your face" "..."
Varshavski sees the bullet.
"Hand me the gauze and the forceps. I see the bullet." "..."

".35 caliber, lodged in the gastrocnemius. Looks like it might have been agonizing."
House raises an eyebrow.
"Agonizing? Tch. I doubt it. Probably was no more than painful at most. I would know what agony feels like."
Mikhali rolls his eyes and puts the bullet down.

Will's Chapter, Chapter 34: "Later, in Heaven"
Obama was plotting something. Something big. He wanted to acquire the power of Barney.
According to the Dei of the Bible II's Chapter 16, Obama's power number is 1, and Barney's is -1. Unlike most power scales, the Dei works backwards. The lower, the better. Barney is essentially the supreme being. Obama doesn't like this, because, well, he MADE Barney, alongside all of the universe back in 0 ABT when he violated the first law of thermodynamics. He knew exactly how to seize power. But where to get it?

Will's Chaptwo, Chapter 35: "The Return of the I-XT"
If you recall, the I-XT was introduced in Chapter 25.96 of the Bible II. One single corrupted I-XT remained after the events of the Jimmicide. It was in the hands of GIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL of Gitrl Land. Obama grabbed his comically large spoon and scooped up the I-XT. He used it to pause the universe in place, and he managed to split Barney in half, absorbing his cerebrospinal fluid. Obama now had a power level of NEGATIVE TWO. Unfortunately for Obama, there was a worm in his brain. The BeneTRANSworm. You see, the BeneTRANSworm is directly related

to Barney. It was P*SSED. The only way to extract the powerful CSF and bring Barney back to life was to steal the I-XT and get a certain doctor to perform the spinal tap...

(Doctor Apartatment Buildoing)

Emily's JDcbyeg45wjukeicksrhiyfbnh, Chapter 36: "Cult Advances"
The High-Pressure Washing Machine Cult became The Peaceful Communist Republic of the High-Pressure Washing Machine Cult. Bingus McFluffernutter III became Bingus McFluffernutter the Third, since the Roman Numerals are too much effort to paste in. Next, the Asparaguitar Cult rose to power. Its leader is Little Asparagus Man, who created the first Asparaguitar by tearing his (regeneratable) arm off and attaching it to the body of a guitar. His general of Army, Backflip Machine, recruited Shower Curtain Eater to help manage the army. Another Cult update was Fred the Second's cult, which he changed into the Paper Towel Tube Cult after finding one and thinking it was pretty neat. TPCRoTHPWMC located these cults and proposed an alliance, since Bingus McFluffernutter the Third felt as though he should help out the aspiring cults in their journey to enlightenment. They also restarted the Soviet Union. Again. However, the Alternates destroyed the Soviet Union as soon as it was created. And also False Gabriel somehow wasn't dead yet. Also the Cults got into a fight with False Gabriel

yaya

(in case you are unaware of Lajwaland, TPCRoTHPWMC stands for The Peaceful Communist Republic of The High Pressure Washing Machine Cult)

Everett's Cekfeuafsndf;e, Chapter 37: "barrier"
The BeneTRANSworm consumed the remains of Barney and made the Crack(tm) which did a cricky dracky and opened up Obama's spinal cavity. The BeneTRANSworm then did a summon the supporters of the PUB, including the Wiki-Rappers back from the [[insert place here]] so they could wiki-rapp the BeneTRANSworm to victory. However, Obama was ready for this and he ated the Wiki-Rappers and consumed the BeneTRANSworm in a fishy glue. The BeneTRANSworm loved the fishy glue so much he summoned Mr Spidy God who placed a barrier on Obama's face, which Obama [[insert end of sentence here]]. The BeneTRANSworm and Mr Spidy God ate the Fishy glue with Mr Sunny Sonny. Then a Glue Fighy appeared and took a bite out of the BeneTRANSworm as payback. The BeneTRANSworm didn't notice becasue they were so TRANSfixed on the fishy glue.

INTERMISSION

Last time on Inanimate Insanity... We now continue with Chapter 38

\Will, Usagi & Everett's Chapter, Chapter 38: "The Spinal Tap"
Suddenly, Doctor House bust into the Heaven holding a glock. House then said "It seems that this man doesn't have lupus. It's never lupus." whips out syringe

PSH

Only blood came into the syringe. They had accidentally taken the blood of the BeneTRANSworm. who looked up from the fighy glue it was eating and tried to get out of it, how, we [[insert end of sentence here]]. The BeneTRANSworm licked the needle becasue (and she will) the BeneTRANSworm is rather [[insert word here]] and very silly.
Emliie then bursts through the door with a 357- magnum and screams, "WAIT! I have detected a TeMpOrAL aNoMaLy here."
"This.... is a banana mystery!"
Emilie loads the magnum and aims with precise precision "PEW PEW PeWRFUME!!!! HAHA TAKE THAT BENESNARTWURM!!!--"
Glu Fig bursts through the door, "--[[insert smell here]] what is [[insert perosn here]]--. I don;t remember [[insert action here]] huh [[mmmmmmmmmm]] [[very yummy smell]] [[so silly]]."
Emilie screams, "YOU'RE NOT EVEN REMOTELY INVOLVED IN THIS SITUATION, GLU FIG!"
"G[[lorb]le grlee[p] I can;t s[[pork]]s" Doctor House looks around in confusion.
"	AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN THIS UNIVERSE, SPRAY BOTTLE!!"
"we only[[eat the bernaner from ]] [[ ]] [[teehee]land]"

Enraged, emile sparta kicks the uninvolved parties out of the room

i shall illustrate this for you: [[insert description here]]

Unfortunately for Emilie and House, False Gabriel is still alive for some godforsaken reason. He bust into Heaven's OR yet again, and whipped out a needle! It's an IV anesthetic. So, it turns out False Gabriel is actually a licensed anesthesiologist and administered an anesthetic to Obama.
House continued. The spunal tap! House re-inserted the needle, with the BeneTRANSworm in godly containment, administered by Romin. It had been done. The Barney CSF had been extracted. However, House had no intention of giving it to Barney. Romin, oblivious to the Anti-Barney status of House and Emilie, Romin quickly grabbed the CSF and stole it from House's hand and quickly let the BTW free and let it transport the CSF to Barney.
The BeneTRANSworm was going at full speed to Barney's corpse, but someone blocked its way. The Jims continued their strict anti-god stances, and attempted to steal the CSF and give it to Jimmy. The Yu-Gi- Oh! Rush Duel took about 5.24 minutes, and the BeneTRANSworm managed to push through in the last second by utilizing its Trap Card.
The BeneTRANSworm then continued on, puking out VHS tapes with

help from the spirit of Hillbilly Jesus, and slowly progressed its way to Barney, stacking more and more tapes to build a bridge. 1 mile.
0.9 miles
0.8 miles
0.6 miles
0.4 miles
0.1 miles Arrival.
The BeneTRANSworm finally got to Bárney. It inserted the CSF back into Barney, and he began singing the PUB theme song and recited Wiki- Rapp quickly, restoring power to the PUIM and in turn, p*ssing off "Obama."

"You guys do realise that I just shot Obama, right?"

THE BEST COLLAB CHAPTER IN BIBBLE HISTORY,CHAPTER 40: "The Banana
Mystery Is Not A Mystery"
Written by Usagi, Will, Everett, and Emily
Main credit to USAGI because USAGI came up with the banana mystery arc (this is true -will)
Will's Section
The banana mystery is still a mystery. At least, that's what Emilie thought.

The banana mystery shall not remain a mystery for very much longer. A body has been found. The scene's marked off with tape. The chalk lines on the ground tracing a familiar shape. There is no case to crack, no charges can be pressed! A banana attack yet no cardiac arrest. (not a song reference definitely)

The banana mystery has been solved. There was no cardiac arrest, only Banana murder! The culprit has been located post-haste as Obama's fingerprints, however, when interrogated by Barney, he has no memory of the event. The only witness with Google!! evidence at the moment is the BeneTRANSworm, who seems to remember everything. Dr. Gregory House has been consulted for further examination, as he was present during the CSF extraction.

Obama seemingly killed himself.
Everett's Section [[no]]

Emily's Section Wite stuff hewa

USAGI'S SECTION:

Part 3: The Conviction
The banana mystery is no longer a mystery. At least, that's what Emilie thought.
Emilie missed a crucial document. It said:
????????????,  ?????????????
Which is norwegian for, "shut up ur wrong looser hahah

Part 4: The Retribution

As it turns out, Barney WAS The Banana Mystery. Bana WAS Barney.
This was a problem, of course, because now all the gods of this universe are dead right now.
But just then, a being of infinite beauty descended from the sky. "Maybe you can keep it down?"
The following scene takes place: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1tkz 0Sxa7Q The herta then rko'd obama back to life

INTERMISSION
Due to plot convenience, Mr. Puzzle's's has been revived because i feel like it.


Chapter 41: "With the power of a god..."
The Herta left. (maybe she'll come back later idk)
TeRiRi worriedly screamed "EMILIE WHY IS EVERYONE DEAD AHHHHHHH"
Emilie replied, (also screaming) "I SHOT OBAMA AND BARNEY IS BANA AND THE HERTA JUST REVIVED OBMAMA BY RKO-ING HIM BACK TO LIFE AND THEN THE HERTA JUST LEFT REALLY"
TeRiRi, still screaming: "WGAT"
ANYWAYS WHILE EMILIE AND TERIRI RECOVER FROM SUCH A SHOCKER, ENJOY THE NEW FILLER ARC!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Part II: Will Riddick - "Ghosts" of the Past writing
JANUARY 1ST, 2012
Firey just closed the gate on Leafy.

After purchasing Dream Island with counterfeit currency, Leafy went home. "Why did he do that?," Leafy thought to herself. Then, suddenly, for some unknown reason, Spongy burst through the roof. "Spongy," Leafy said, "WHY ARE YOU IN MY HOUSE? Could you just not DESTROY MY EXPENSIVE SHINGLES???" "oops," responded Spongy. "Uh, anyways," Spongy said, "I was sent here as a ghost to warn-" "You're not dead." Leafy interjected. Spongy then proceeded to suddenly contract bird flu and die on the spot. "Anyways," Spongy's ghost continued, "I'm here because if you don't be a Google!! person, you're going to get hit by this conveniently placed train on this track conveniently running through your house!" "Oh, so that's what that was..." Leafy responded. "Anyways, you're gonna get visited by three little silly guys who discovered alternate dimensions tonight. Bye!" Spongy said, flying away at 299,792,458.1 meters per second. Leafy then went to sleep, terrified. Then the first guy showed up and kidnapped leafy and transported her to the Center for Creative Contemplation, a place for all ages to contemplate their life choices. The first guy is named Bob. He's an object, but he's named Bob. Pretty cool, right? Anyways, Bob is an oscilloscope. He said, "Welcome to the CCC, where people such as you can contemplate your life choices and talk to the people you wronged!" "But", Leafy interjected, "wasn't Firey also in the wrong?" Bob responded, "You could've looked what you've done together before!" "Like that one time you two went camping in the middle of a lake! Or that time you went fishing with Bubble!" "You're both friends, you just had a little oopsie.
Now, I'm done here. I've already encoded all the footage into your brain, so get out now! Bye!" he said. "Wh-" Leafy began to speak but was quickly reinstated in her bedroom. Then, about 15 minutes later, Leafy was kidnapped, again, but Cthing Lthat Oyou Ctell Kthe, also known as Clock (ITFT). Clock decided to show Leafy some live footage of the chaos unfolding on the previous site of Dream Island, where there was now a

simple stone platform. There was screaming, rioting, and for some reason, prayer. After seeing the footage, Leafy asked if "This is what I caused?" Clock responded, "Yepperinodoodlydoo!" Leafy stuttered. Just in plain shock at what she had caused. She felt horrible, and like she needed to change. Clock warned her that "He is coming." Leafy responded "Is this an attempt at preaching??" Clock responded, "No, I'm talking about Cobs." "Who?" Leafy asked. "Steven Lee Paul Cobs, founder of Meeple," Clock answered. Cobs then proceeded to kidnap Leafy because "I'm getting paid". That's an actual quote. Cobs showed the entire new competition based on hunting down Leafy and taking back Dream Island, saying nothing but "the future is so yesterday." Finally, Leafy lost her crap and barged the heck out of there. She proceeded to revisit Dream Island's gate and return the deed to Firey. They made up and all was well, at least until the MePhone 6 attacks of 2014.

Will's Chapter, Chapter 45: "gaming"
In the grandiose year of some time around 1197 (woag time skip), the Trees evolved very quickly next to a plutonium refinery in Saskatchewan, Canada. This specific species of Tree, called "Arborus entelligus" developed a brand new idea. What if we made board games for our doohickeys? They quickly hired the Amish to build them a really big shed to begin development on an Pear II port of Checkers. Of course, this took them many months, but in late 1197, they released TV Checkers, the first ever video game. Of course, Japan already invented video games in 952, but they're still isolated in this timeline. Tree Game Development as a studio was booming! They made hundreds with their next games "Scrimmy Bingus and the Crungy Spingus" published by Crogus Interactive selling 4.7 million copies and "Skuntle Bingoid's Big Day" selling 54 thousand copies. Eventually, they had to migrate with the

changing electronic climate, and began selling their games for the Nintendo 3DS. They began by releasing "Scrimmy Bingus and the Crungy Spingus 2: Attack of the Magical Children" in 1198, which sold 1 million copies. However, something bad was happening behind the scenes at Tree Game Development, now named Tree Studios Ltd. You see, their publisher, Crogus, technically owned the Scrimmy Bingus copyrights and just licensed it the Tree Studios, and since Scrimmy Bingus was their bestselling game, Tree Studios couldn't afford to lose it. Unfortunately, since Crogus realized that Scrimmy Bingus and the Crungy Spingus 2 lost them 6 United States Gay Dollars, and prevented Tree Studios from ever using the IP again. Unfortunately for Crogus, their game development department absolutely reeked. Scrimmy Bingus and the Crungy Spingus 3: Return of the Bingus in late 1198 was such a failure that Crogus was forced to lay off 35% of its employees. Tree Studios was sympathized with by the public, and their legally distinct game "Scrimblo Bingus and the Crungly Springus" sold 100,000 copies in its first 2 weeks. Although Tree Studios was forced to shut down by the PUIM in 1213, it's still 1198 sooo yeah.

Usagi's Chapter, Chapter 46: "The Birth of Mingus Dingus"
One day, TeRiRi received a mysteriously suspicious text from an unknown number.
It contained a link to a survey. The survey promised a free 750$ Walmart gift card upon completion. TeRiRi watches Atomic Shrimp and Pleasant Green on youTube, so she could tell that the survey was a scam to get her information. Nonetheless, TeRiRi decided to do some trolling.
The survey asked for her name, she put Mingus Dingus. The survey asked for her date of birth, she put 6/9/69.

The survey asked for her state and city, she put the location as No, Ohio. The survey asked for her address, she put ur mums house
The survey asked for her phone number, TeRiRi is smart, and put a Hollywood number (555).
The survey asked for her email, I cannot write it here due to the explicit nature of the email TeRiRi wrote.
The survey asked if she was willing to spend time with God. TeRiRi selected no.
The survey asked a bunch of other targeted ad questions. A screen popped up.
"Your gift card is ready, Mingus!" TeRiRi submitted the survey.
And Mingus Dingus was born.

Usagi's second Chapter in a row, Chapter 47: "Further TeRi Origins"
I feel that one of the many great heroes of gatcha(pronounced gah-cha or g?-cha) games is Honkai Impact 3rd's Theresa Apocalypse.

She acted as a mother-figure to many of the protagonists after her colleague Himeko's death.
She was the Principal of the Valkyrie Training school, St. Freya's. She's also in her forties, however she looks like she's fourteen.

1.	Familial Relations
Cecilia was the wife of Theresa's brother, Sigefried Kaslana.
Cecilia worked under Theresa's grandather, Otto, at Schickscal, a military group dedicated to combating the beings called the honkai (or houkai when referring to the energy form). Cecilia's two daughters, Bianka and Kiana, currently also work as Valkyries (soldiers) for Schickscal, and her

adopted daughter, Sirin (sometimes mentioned as Celine) was corrupted by the houkai and was contained within Kiana's consciousness (until the Magical Girl School arc).

Theresa's grandfather, Otto, had created her as a clone of his childhood crush, Kallen Kaslana. Because Theresa is a clone, her height and appearance are fixed. Theresa's relationship with her grandfather greatly deteriorated when Otto declared war on Anti-Entropy, the North American branch of Schickscal. Theresa switched sides to join Anti-Entropy's Sovereign, Welt Yang.

1.	Void Queen and Murata Himeko's Death
       Otto kidnapped Kiana, Cecilia's daughter, after Theresa joined Anti-Entropy. Kiana was used as a vessel for a honkai Herrscher's memories and abilities, and thus she became the Void Queen. Otto's original plan for the Void Queen was to use her to decimate humanity. However, the Void Queen has her own agenda (as she should	).
Welt Yang and Theresa make a tailor-made houkai-resistant battlesuit for Theresa's friend and colleague, Major Murata Himeko. The battlesuit was made to carry a vial of liquid that, when injected, could neutralize the overwhelming houkai energy in Kiana's body, allowing her to regain her own consciousness. The houkai cure is given to Kiana, but Himeko dies from houkai overexposure after the Void Queen breaches Himeko's battlesuit and beats her within an inch of her life.

       A few months later, Theresa has a meeting arranged with another Anti-Entropy figure, Cocolia. Cocolia was (Theresa's student) Bronya's caretaker until Bronya left for St. Freya's. Theresa and Bronya both go to meet Cocolia, who has brought Bronya's friends Rozaliya and Liliya from the orphanage. They meet in a place called The Deep. Bronya finds an entrance to the Sea of Quanta in The Deep, and goes to find her friend

Seele, who was trapped in the Sea a few years prior due to a mistake during an experiment.
Meanwhile, Theresa learns that Cocolia set up the meeting to lure her into Schickscal territory because Cocolia actually works for Otto and Schickscal. Theresa kills Cocolia after she threatens to take Liliya's life by stabbing her in the throat. Then a mystery guy shows up and Theresa beats him to a pulp too. Afterwards, he takes the form of a honkai beast and eats Liliya. Liliya is rescued by her twin Rozaliya, and Theresa admits the two into St. Freya's.

1.	Otto's Defeat
Years later, Kiana becomes a Herrscher (without being injected with corrupted houkai) not once, but twice as the Herrscher of Flamesecon (which Kiana gathered purified houkai through her bonds with her friends, her partner, and her mentors) and again as the Herrscher of Finality (which she became after embracing the Cocoon of Finality). Kiana defeats Otto as the Herrscher of Flamesecon.

After that, Theresa works a brief stint as an idol (TeRiRi!) and then again as a mentor, except this time towards Sirin (the Herrscher Kiana was possessed with for a while), Vollerrei (Seele's evil personality), and Broboli (Bronya after she became the second Herrscher of Reason, with the first being Welt Yang).

       Theresa then takes over as Schickscal's Overseer. She reunites Anti-Entropy and Schickscal, and is the biggest name in the Moon and Mars expeditions. Theresa becomes VERY fond of vacations after taking over as the Overseer of Schickscal. On mars, Theresa meets the Dreamseeker, but if I write any more, my hand will be paralysed forever, so I'm gonna stop here.

Will's Chapter, Chapter 49: "The Day the Frogs Turned Gay"
One day, some guy named Glingus McBingus was working in the Geigy laboratories and invented a herbicide! It was called Atrazine(r), and it did its job killing weeds. However, there was one little side effect. This side effect is the complete feminization of male frogs. As a pathetic excuse for a wise man once put it on his not-at-all wise TV show, InglusJars, "I don't like 'em putting chemicals in the water that are TURNING THE FRIGGIN' FROGS GAY!!!" Of course, who honestly cares about that loser's opinion. He can go  for all
I care. Anyways, most people were perfectly okay with this since gay
people are the primary population of the OUSA, but the "Straight Gang" were apparently against this. 98.4% of the population thought the gay frogs were fine. They disagreed.

Emily's Chapter, Chapter 51: Scimmy bingus and the crungy spingus + Gargatha
Despite this chapter's name, it actually has nothing to do with Scrimmy bingus and the crungy spingus and gargatha.
It all started when the bee movie first aired. Evret (this is totally not referencing anyone we know in real life) went to the movie theatres to watch the bee movie. Since it was crowded as heck he took the only open seat next to Abraham Lincoln. And that was where it began. It started off with just watching the bee movie, but then grew into something more.
Evret and Abraham Lincoln eventually got married and adopted a dog for some reason idk chat
But then, conflict sparked.
Over the course of one month, Evret and Abraham Lincon got into numerous fights, eventually resulting in a divorce. Everyone was sad for some reason even though this shouldn't concern literally anyone. But then they got remarried! Then divorced. Then remarried! Then divorced. This repeated like idk 999999999 times until eventually, Evret met someone named Jimothy dying of ebola on the streets (ALSO totally not referencing anyone we know in real life) and they instantly hit it off. Don't worry about Abraham Lincoln, he's with Barack Obama (not to be confused with the god Barack Obama) and they adopted one more dog but took the first one in the divorce. Evret was heartbroken at the loss of his dog, Mouldy Sandwich. So, he did what any reasonable person mourning loss would do.
He got a flamethrower and broke into Abraham Lincoln's mansion and tried to arson him.
But then, he accidentally torched Jimothy. Jimothy was rushed to the hospital and was dying of lung cancer somehow. In an astonishing plot twist, Barack Obama showed up to visit Evret and Jimothy in the hospital

with a proposition. Obama would provide Evret with the technology necessary to make a Jimothy clone, transferring Jimothy's consciousness into the clone to keep him alive. And so, Evret and Barack Obama worked on the thingamajig to bring Jimothy back. At the end, Jimothy was revived, but Barack Obama gave up his life essence to restore Jimothy.
Depressed at the loss of Barack Obama, Abraham Lincoln took his life and hanged himself.


Chapter 52: "The Gettysburg Address"
This is not a joke. A guy named Edward Everett wrote a transcript of the Gettysburg Address. Here it is. Updated for B3 compliance of course.

Four score and seven years ago our father brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.

It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here, have, thus far, so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation, under Obama, shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Chapter 54: "Magickal Girl Everletta and evil man Meet Gargatha, Eye of the Heavens and the Destroyer of Worlds"
Fun fact, news flash, mingus has an aunt.
Her name is Gargatha, Eye of the Heavens and Destroyer of Worlds. Magickal Girl Everletta had dedicated its life to defeating evil, like evil man. evil man is now on the Google!! side now despite his name. Now Magickal Girl Everletta and evil man face a new, evil-er enemy.
Gargatha, Eye of the Heavens and Destroyer of Worlds.
Gargatha was once a small town in Accomack County, Virginia. One day, Gargatha became bored. All people did all day was exist on her.
BOOOORRRRINNNNGGG.
Somewhere along the line, Gargatha's roads started to crack and get lotsa potholes. Potholes are like the Gargatha equivalent of boils.
Gargatha was called a leper by all of her friends. Gargatha was a very kawaii town, too. Being called a leper led to Gargatha becoming distraught and wallowing in her own, self-directed sympathy.
"Must I be fated to stay in such a perigee of joy? Aye, foremost am I in my own sin and gloom. Forevermore will I suffer such a kismet. To change anything, you must rely only upon yourself, and I, I am nought but a town. I've no self to rely upon."
Pathetic. Tragic.
One day Magickal Girl Everletta and evil man were walking down Dingly Mills Road.
thumpthumpthump
Magickal Girl Everletta said, "looks like someone's pronouns are fee/fi/fo/fum! Lol!"
Gargatha responded, "SHUT IT STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE!"

Will's Chapter, Chapter 56: "The Legend"
Once upon a time, many, many years ago, there was nothing. Nothing but empty space. FUID#2391 was an empty, empty abyss. In fact,

FUID#2391 didn't exist until February 23rd, 2024. It all truly started many moons ago...

Once upon a time, a LEGEND was whispered among shadows. It was a LEGEND of BARACK.
It was a LEGEND of OBAMA. It was a LEGEND of CHILI.
It was a LEGEND of FEET.
This is the legend of BIBBLE TWO
For millennia, CHILI-FEET and BARACK OBAMA have lived in balance, Bringing peace to the WORLD.
But if this harmony were to shatter... a terrible calamity would occur.
The sky will run straight with terror
And the land will become straight with fear. Then, its heart pounding...
The FUID#2391 will draw its final breath. Only then, shining with hope...
Three HEROES appear at WORLDS' edge. A BARNEY,
A BINGUS MCFLUFFERNUTTER III,
And a ROMIN FROM YU-GI-OH! SEVENS.
Only they can seal Obana
And banish the BEING FROM THIS REALM. Only then will balance be restored,
And the FUID saved from destruction. Today, the LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS-
The laws that gives this land form- Stand tall at the center of the FUID.
But recently, a VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS has
appeared on the horizon...

And with it, the balance of CHILI-FEET and BARACK OBAMA begins to shift...

ringalingalingaling
Barney: Who is it?
PUIM Agent: It's PUIM agent codename NJM. Barney: Okay, but why exactly are you calling me?
NJM: We've received a series of SOS messages dating back to 1000 from someone. Their ID is BHO-2.
Barney: Obama? He's literally right over there, why would he be in an alternate FUID?
NJM: That's... not Obama.
Barney: You know, he has been acting a tad bit evil recently, you know, with him stealing my cerebrospinal fluid and all.
NJM: Can you run a scan on this impostor?
Barney: His ID is "BHÓ-II" and the full name is listed as "Barack Hussien Obana II."
NJM: Seems like we have our culprit, then. The messages also state that the only way to defeat Obana is via a Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel.
Barney: Hey, what's this DVD on the ground?

NJM: I don't know. Play it.
DVD Player: THE LEGEND.mp4
Barney: This is literally a prophecy. Wow. NJM: Oh, cool. Im gonna go now.
beep, beep, beeep
Barney: So these three heroes are I, Bingus McFluffernutter III, and Romin.
Romin from Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens: did somebody speak my name Barney: FOR THE LOVE OF BARACK OBA- oh hi romin
Romin from Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens: Yes, it is I, Romin from Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens. Look at me go with my Duel Guitar.
Bingus McFluffernutter III: It is I, Bingus McFluffernutter III, head of The High Pressure Washing Machine Cult, which is part of the PUB, which is now the PUIM, which is under you, Barney.
Barney: o-okay
Barney: Anyways, apparently we need Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duels to defeat evil Obama???
BMcFN III: WHAT
Barney: Just watch this video DVD Player: THE LEGEND.mp4
BMcFN III: I get it now! Also, what are these messages that you definitely mentioned?
TeRiRi: Bingo Bongo! I'm here too!
Barney: AAA- FOR THE LOVE OF THE BENETRANSWORM
TeRiRi: Bongo Bingo! I'm no longer here too!
Barney: O-okay, anywho apparently Obama is trapped in an alternate universe and the Obama here since AD 434 is obaNa. One letter difference.
Romin from Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens: Well, that explains the entire Banana Mystery Arc.

Barney: Also, the last part of the second message may concern you, Romin.
PUIM Terminal: "His secret weakness is Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duels. All I need to do is find some way to borrow a deck from R"
Barney: That's where the message cuts off. His Chili-Communicator is probably long dead.
BMcFN III: I propose we call upon the PD³.
Barney: The PUIM Dimensional Defense Department? But Chili-Feet aren't effective in FUID#6667 where Obama is trapped!
BMcFN III: What I mean is we use the recent CF-Portal prototype to get there and Rush Duel.
Barney: Allow me to phone them.
PUIM Agent: Sir! The CF-Portal is being updated and will not be in service for about a month. I have a plan, however.
Barney: Okay, what's your plan then?
PUIM Agent: We need to harness the magnetic field of the planet Lingus to gather the energy needed to travel outside the spacetime continuum. Barney: ARE YOU CRAZY? Lingus' magnetic field deactivates any Chili- powered device!!
PUIM Agent: That's because its magnetic field IS Chili-Energy. We can harvest it by usi-
BMcFN III: THE HIGH PRESSURE WASHING MACHINE! THAT'S IT!
Barney: Okay, but how in the name of Obama are we going to get that to the core of Lingus? It's like 2 jupiters big!
BMcFN III: It's called that not only because it creates high pressure, but it can withstand it.
Barney: WELL WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? PREPARE THE LEONOV!
Romin from Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens: Okay quick question though, who's kid was THAT??!!

Chapter 58: "1198: The Year We Kill Jimmy"
\\\ INTERMISSION \\\
For some context, the Leonov is the space ship that goes to Jupiter again in 2010: Odyssey Two/The Year We Make Contact. It's a callback to "1001: A Space Odyssey."
\\\ BACK2THESHOW \\\

Barney: How exactly will we stay a safe distance away from Lingus? Chief of the PUIM Interstellar Spacetravel Service: Our top scientists estimate that a distance of 0.1 Earth radii is the closest you can get. You can then extend the High Pressure Washing Machine Extension Apparatus.
Barney: Well, then. Let's get going.
Chief of the P!SS: Wait, we need to insert the PLCC. Barney: What's that?
Chief of the P!SS: The PUIM-Leonov Chili Core. Barney: Ahh, okay. Welp, it looks to be in now! Let's go. ship is boarded
2 Months Later...
BMcFN III: We're HEEERE!
Barney: Alrighty-doo-dah, let's like uhhhh activate the Arm.

The energy meter then went from 0 GW, to 5 GW in milliseconds. The meter quickly reached terawatts, and then petawatts, and finally, exawatts.

13.4 EXAWATTS. A fraction of the Sun is now in the hands of the Major Gods.

Barney: YES. We've done it.

Romin from Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens: Woohoo

Chapter 59: "The Portal"
Barney, Bingus McFluffernutter III, and Romin from Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens had made it. They had attained all of the energy to make 37 round-trips to FUID#6667 and back. Now all they had to do... is to open it. The CF- Portal is stored safely underground on a moon orbiting Jupiter, known simply as "papayaville." papayaville is the center for trade between the PUIM and other interplanetary tribes, which are few and far between. The PUIM base of operations is on papayaville. Anyways, the coordinates 35.6178575, -83.4797512, or Mount Mingus, are where the CF-Portal Testing Area is. Our protagonists shoved the High Pressure Energy Cartridge into the HPEC slot that was just retrofitted onto the portal. Since it now had power, it was able to produce three return pads from the minerals in the air. It also placed 1 terawatt of energy into Barney's communicator for it to remain effective. Finally, they walked in, It felt normal to them since they had travelled dimensions before, but something felt odd about FUID#6667. It was entirely empty. A vacuum.
The only thing there was Obama. Originally, only Obana was here. Alone. Quiet. Too quiet.

She hoped it would maybe make its way to the HEROES. She knew the chance was slim.
A gale played in TeRiRi's ears, leading her to pin them down. A lullaby whispered its way along the dusky sky.

May	the birds	break free	their cage Sunbeams  filtering	through	foliage

TeRiRi knew this song well. Her friend, Perrie, used to hum the tune whilst they traveled together.
TeRiRi recalled some memories of Perrie.
Perrie was a little girl looking for her way back to her kingdom. TeRiRi had offered to accompany her.
But The Hearthfire beat Perrie there. And it consumed her, too.
As TeRiRi stood amid the flames of the kingdom, she found herself worrying when she would burn.
When she would be left as cinders and soot and ashes. But that made no sense.

You see, The Hearthfire was her doing.
In order to become a deity in this Universe, TeRiRi took the combined power of ten monarchs.
Each monarch had a precious gemstone from where they derived their power. The gemstones were referred to as "Cornerstones."

TopazAventurineJadePearlSugaliteAmberAgateObsidianSapphireOpal
She took the power by burning the monarchs' kingdoms and seizing their Cornerstone.
And with this power, she's only done two things.
Bested Obama in a battle, and created a calamitous being unlike any other:

The bib1 III
The Bib1 III Starring Sirin

Preface
A time before faces lol


Chapter I, Act I, 'Creation Arc'
So a cool anime girl made the universe because duh. Her name is Sirin and she uses scissors. (kindergarten menace much?)

So poof everything exists, everyone exists, sirin's still lonely so she cries in the corner of the universe for only 19 centuries and then is like screw it imma see what happens when i interact with my creations.


Chapter II, Act I, 'Travel Arc'
So basically sirin just goes planet hopping and no one talks to her because in other galaxies there is NO ONE :)
So after 100 years of traveling she ends up in a galaxy she named Honkai but the stupid squishy things call it "the milky way" which is stoopid they had to name it after candy bars with so called "fun" size which ARE ACTUALLY SUPER SMOL-
It took her about 24 years to get to earth, with earth being the last planet to visit, which means on average it took her 3 years to explore every inch of said planet PER planet, which means she visited 34 planets previously.
(i'm not a math kid i swear im just a stats kid-)


Chapter III, Act II, 'human'
As sirin is just chilling on earth and she decides to live on earth so she becomes an eighth grader (most intimidating thing known to elementary- kind) so she gets a legit outfit (shown to right) so basically she makes friends with a kid named Mene, who is abnormally obsessed with being abnormal. So they're like pookies and and share stuff like pens and erasers and anything EXCEPT for sirin's scissors
BECAUSE THEY'RE SIRIN"S SCISSORS NOT MENE"S THEY ARE SIRIN'S SCISSORS >:(

Chapter IV, Act II, 'senior year of high school'
Yippie its almost the end of the school year and what type of school event is exclusive to seniors in high school? Prom yippie and no one asks mene or sirin out so they end up going to only photobomb every couple! Funni plarnk!


Chapter V, Act III, 'the problem with humans'
Humans are weak. They live, and they die. Nothing more, nothing less.
To think of such cute creatures, yet they die as easily as scraping algae off a boat.
Pathetic creatures.
 So why is Sirin crying over one such speck of dust? What could some insignificant filth make Sirin cry about?


Chapter VI, Act III, 'chaos but pronounced like 'chos''
Once upon a crime there was a big bad motorbike gang that were wanted timinals.
And then there was Sirin.
The leader of the gang (named 'skrib')(which is short for skibidi crib) decided to mix bleach and rubbing alcohol and shove the mixture into Sirin's face (funni plarnk pt2!)
Sirinnapping!!!
Mene started to freak out (emo panik attacc)
Enter furina, "the gayest heterosexual person you will ever meet" Insert gay giggles
Exit furina, "the gayest heterosexual person you will ever meet"

Then 18 days later mene built up the courage to wield an ack42 asgrainofsalt riftl

Kaboom yaya


Intermission
Indeed, this was the Bib1 III

Intermission II: Electric Boogaloo
With Obana mysteriously missing and the other gods going to rescue Obama, HAEVEN is left in chaos without a ruler...

Will's Chapter, Chapter 64: "All Hail Hatsune Miku"
In the year 1004, a little Japanese conglomerate called Yamaha made a vocal synthesizer software called Vocaloid. Anyways, Hatsune Miku escaped the Wi-Fi and became a person. She later died in 1024 in a tragic accident and went to HAEVEN. Since HAEVEN currently has no ruler, the Obamangels held an election for temporary leader of heaven. Since being a Vocaloid fan has been a requirement to go to HAEVEN since 1016, effectively everyone there voted for Hatsune Miku, and thus she was instated as Temporary Leader of HAEVEN.
She also updated the flag: ORIGINAL FLAG


UPDATED FLAG


Usagi's Chapter, Chapter 65: "Hibiki Lui, Ci Flower, Galaco, vflower, Yokane Ruko, Kiana Kalsana, and Mirai all fight over the last Capri- sun"
Fun fact, everyone mentioned (except Hibiki Lui) is a vocal synth :0 Oops now they're all fighting over- hey THATS MY CAPRISUN

Chapter 65.5: "What happens when you submit an essay ???? to a society ???? and you get no ?? honorable mention or response??????"
Once a pond of lime, a "person" named usagi wrote a beautiful essay about Biomass energy. The essay went something like this:

Biomass: Future in Waste
Biomass energy uses organic waste to create power, essentially eliminating the need for organic landfills. Biomass comes from plant and algae based material such as crop waste, food waste, forest residue and microalgae. A few ways to convert energy from biomass are bacterial decay, burning, and conversion to a liquid fuel. Ethanol (a type of biofuel) is used in Austria, Sweden, and the United States to power vehicles. By burning the waste, we create energy. This could help us reduce our reliance upon flammable fossil fuels, like coal, that are buried in the ground from prehistoric organisms.
Biomass burns cleaner than petroleum and could create a world for future generations. A benefit of biomass is that it closes the carbon cycle and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

A potential use of biomass is that it is a subtle way to ease our reliance off of fossil fuels.
However, a byproduct of burning biomass as fuel is the remaining carbon dioxide produced from the fire can contribute to global warming and ocean acidification. Now, allow me to pose the question of; "where do we draw the line between sustainability and environmental damage?"
Of course, many people would vouch for the ideal where we would never run out of waste, but biofuel is demanding. It has an extremely low efficiency. For example, geothermal energy can be up to 400% more efficient than biomass energy.
The cost of using biomass as energy varies, because of land and water use, and is usually more expensive than wind or solar energy. Nuclear energy could be the power of the future, but it is not renewable. Perhaps this means biomass energy isn't a permanent solution, but a temporary one.

NOTHING.
AND NOW USAGI CHANNELS THIS ANGER INTO THIS CHAPTER CAUSE LETS FINISH THE DANG BIBBLE III ARLRESDYYYYYYy


Chapter 66: "usagiyap"
Maybe when the performance task is over, I can write about it in my journal. It's not breaking the honor code because we're the last class to have the performance task. If I could think of more to write about at the moment, I would totally write about it. Tomorrow I have my District Chorus Audition. I've signed up as an alto, so we'll see how that goes. In chorus today, we split into our voice groups to practise our songs. We altos did Google!!, in my opinion. Except Isabel missed a note and yelled, which made us all break down in laughs. Probably didn't write about this, but I got my chorus uniform fitted yesterday. Earlier in math class, everyone was talking about Mr. Fritzinger's 6-7 speech from yesterday. I responded with an extremely nasally "SIXX SEVEENNN" and a very, very annoying laugh (Like, a singular "HAAAAAHHH!!"). I think that that was peak entertainment. I'll have to remind myself on the bus to say hi to Skye.
During focus, I watched a video of a foil bout. On Sunday, I have D&D. I really wish it lasted more than two hours, because it's really fun. I've also signed up for D&D Club at school, so I hope that'll be fun as well. Colton decided to shake my light blue paint marker for the entirety of yesterday's art class, and now it works again. Colton's kinda silly like that :p. My hair is continuing to grow in super dark and super thick. I'm not sure that I like it that way.

Usagi's first essay of 2024
Bfdi is a fantasy-animation game show that originated in the United States in 2010. Written by a set of twin brothers, Cary and Michael

Huang, Bfdi is widely regarded as the origin of a genre known as "object shows." Object shows are a genre of media usually defined as a bunch of anthropomorphic objects screaming at each other. The run time of the first season is roughly four hours. BFDI is formulated a lot like the show reality tv game show, Survivor. The show is set in a region named Goiky, and the plot is as follows:

The first season starts with everyone living casually. Then the announcer falls from the sky and tells all 20 characters about a place known as Dream Island (which one character comments, "Dream Island? That sounds like a disease!"). The characters are swept into competition and split into two main teams, The Squishy Cherries and The Squashy Grapes.
Elimination is known as cake at stake. If you are safe, you get a cake (or anything else, really)
And if you get the most votes (votes are cast by real humans), you are eliminated and go to the Tiny Loser Chamber to sit in grief for eternity.

The Third Season is titled IDFB, and is one episode long.
Yeah. A lot of people are mad about that.

The current season (season five) is titled The Power Of Two. The latest episode (as of nov 17th 2024) is episode 14.

Bungo Stray Dogs is an anime that follows a character named Atushi, who interrupts the suicide (via drowning) attempt of a man named Dazai. Dazai thanks Atushi, but displays a bit of disappointment at the ceasure of his plan.
Dazai offers Atushi a position at his work, the Armed Detective Agency. Looking deeper into Dazai's past, we find that Dazai was previously a member of the Port Mafia. The Port Mafia is an exploitative group and is very hard to get untangled with.
       Dazai was able to get out of the Port Mafia with the assistance of one of the so-called lesser members, Sakunosuke Oda. Oda is called Odasaku most of the time for simplicity. Odasaku is often referred to as an underdog for his pacifistic tendencies. He carries some trauma from the bombing of his orphanage.

Odasaku takes it upon himself to rescue a maiden (Young Dazai) from the Port Mafia. Odasaku saves Dazai and then proceeds to die practically on the spot. Dazai later joins the Armed Detective Agency.
Dazai leaves the love of his life (he's in denial), Chuuya Nakahara, in the Port Mafia. Chuuya and Dazai 'flirt' a lot. Chuuya embodies his role of femme fatale when he kills, like, fifteen people. Using his fedora, specifically. Dazai is still in severe denial.


Usagi's Chapter, Chapter : "Doomed yuri written in the middle of gym class"
Day I
I: Thou shall work diligently

Nessa walked through the wheat field and itched at her leg.
The grains kept piercing through the material of her dress and it started to annoy her skin.
It was dawn and Nessa was meeting up with her friend, Imogen.
It was the only time of day when they could talk about certain topics, such as the world beyond and the leader and, above all, the blood.
They'd sit in trees on the outskirts of the fields.
The trees just behind the line where the forest started and the meadows and field of grain receded.
To laze around under the morning sun was a luxury for her. Nessa arrived at the designated tree.
She greeted Imogen and climbed to the branch she was on.
Nessa had been sick the week before, and Imogen was glad to see her recovering well.

Day CXLIX
XXXI: Thou shall not speak any evil

Nessa had attended a biweekly seminar about the XXXIX Pious Tenets. The usual "speak, do , say no evil and have no ill wishes against anyone." It was...
Quite boring and tedious.
Of course she could never say that aloud or to anyone. She could tell Imogen at least.
But it got super lonely.
???? C???? ????? ????? ???

Day CLXIV
XXXII: Thou shall not act or think unorthodox

When she woke, all she could hear was people cheering and a few screams. She quickly got dressed in her black twill and oxford dress and ran to check the crowds. A huge pillar of smoke formed. Nessa initially suspected it stemmed from a bonfire.
Squishing herself to the front, Nessa could see Imogen through the flames. Imogen was nailed to two intersecting planks of wood. One end for her left arm, one for her head , one for both of her legs, and another for her right arm. Her clothes were tattered and thin, as if they were eaten by moths. Liquid scarlet covered the left side of her face. A gash near the eyebrow acted like a waterfall, seeming to be an endless sourcewater of crimson. Neither Imogen's little sister nor her little brother were among the burning stakes. However, a small piercing shriek was soon heard by Nessa, where she saw the brother. Instead of pinning him to a plank, they dragged the five year old to the big oak tree I wasn't allowed to climb.
Astor took the boy and threaded him through a noose attached to the tree. It reminded Nessa of the action of threading a needle, for sewing or

whatnot. They left him to dangle by the neck as he hopelessly tried to loosen the rope.
Imogen started lightly crying. The tears were dyed red amidst the bloodied face of 'Imogen'. Her wrists clenched in tight chains. In her final moments, she locked eyes with Nessa and mouthed "I'm sorry" or whatever it was.
Maybe if Imogen didn't die, Nessa would be happier. But, no. Nessa had to force herself to rejoice upon Imogen's death.
Just like everyone else.
As orthodox as everyone else.
Rejoice and laugh at the crucifixion of Imogen Guillebeaux.

Day CLXVI
XXXIII: Thou shall not hide from law

Asta, Imogen's sister, was hiding in her room at the time of the execution. She was small enough to hide under the staircase without being noticed when the Guillebeauxes were seized. Likely ran up to her room to watch the ordeal from her window, and was now under her bed, clutching to a rag that was cinched with twine so it looked like it had a tumor with buttons sewn onto the growth.
Nessa went to Imogen's now abandoned house. It was to not be inhabited for the next year. Her hand briefly touched the aspen banister that they had so fondly slid down together as kids. Memories grew more vivid the farther she walked into the abode. She ripped the dead hyacinths on the dining table up, and tried to grind them into the splintering floorboards. She didn't know why, but she felt she had to.
After a while of sitting on the floor, she hoisted herself upstairs, entering rooms one after another. Imogen's parent's room, Imogen's brother's room, Asta's room, Imogen's room...

Drawings of flowers and trees were scattered across the walls in a helpless manner.
Drawings of Imogen's family, smiling as they ate, drawings of the lynxes they'd see together in winter. And under the bed, there was a small, fading drawing of Imogen, holding hands with Nessa, as they sat on a tree branch. It looked like Imogen had tried to erase it a few times out of

I'm legally mandated to have a mingus dingus mention on page 69 fear. Barely visible against the wall, but distinct against the strict
expectations and ideals of the town's majority. There was a small butterfly drawing next to the one of Nessa and Imogen.
That was the butterfly Nessa drew some time ago. Maybe one or two hundred days ago?

The drawing of the tree-
Nessa remembered that Imogen kept a box in that tree. "Nessa?"
Nessa turned around. It was Asta.
"Asta? You're alive?"

That's a great gift for Mingus! I am sure that he will love it! Mingus and his friends are gathered around the gift table. First, he unwraps the explosives from Gato.
After that, he unwraps Dingley's Mill Road from Gargatha.

Then, he opens the wisdom from Wise Mystical Tree and eats every can of miller lite. Like, the entire can. No one comments on it because they know what happened to the ones who did
Mingus opens the help me please oh god HELP ME PLEASE GOD OH GOD HELP ME OH GOD HELP ME HELP ME from the withered corpse of Bee's Broken L Key.

Then, he opens the genocide from Glagglecre's homeland. "Yay! This is exactly what I wanted!" Mingus happily exclaims.
We're not quite done yet, Mingus! There's one super special gift left! "Really? I can't wait to see what it is!" Mingus cheers.
Time to give your gift to Mingus!
Mingus' friends excitedly crowd around him as he opens your gift. Everyone turns a blind eye to the fact that Fih is no longer here. To comment upon it would spell their demise.
"Wow! This is amazing! This is the best birthday ever! You guys are the greatest friends ever!"
Everyone has a giant group hug.
"I'm so happy I got to celebrate my birthday with you all! Now, who's ready for cake?" Mingus asks, pointing to his birthday cake.
Everyone lets out various sounds of approval. Mingus hyuks hyukingly.
You never decline anything Mingus offers you.

After that, the friends forcibly happily eat their slices of what they hope is just cake, jovially chatting with one anoth
WHY DOES THE CAKE TASTE LIKE SEAFOOD

Less Cool Chapter, Chapter 70: "I Can't See the End of the Horizon"
As you may recall, Hatsune Miku and Kasane Teto and Akita Neru and MEIKO and KAITO and Kagamine Rin and Kagamine Len have been instated as the new gods of HAEVEN while the others are absent. Only one Obamangel was banished for not liking Teto. Other than that, everything was going well. Jimmy was still angry he wasn't god, the remaining I-XTs that didn't belong to the PUIM became powerless, and most people didn't even know about the change in leadership. Everything was peaceful on Earth². Well, by 'was,' I really do mean 'was.' You see, Japan was still a secluded island country with no access to the outside world in 1197. No one other than people there knew about Vocaloid, Miku, or anything of the sort. In fact, the Japanese were their own people with their own culture and religion. Despite this, they utilize most aspects of outside technology, albeit in Japanese and invented before the OUSA created it. However, there is one exception...nah not really

Cool Chapter, Chapter 71: "Bob and Larry Overthrow the Government"
There were two individuals not happy with Hatsune Miku's takeover of HAEVEN; Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber, the gayest vegetable couple known to hoo-mans. Bob went to a car dealership.
"Hello, I'd like to buy a car" "Which car do you want?" "That one"
"Which one"
"The Toyota Thatone" "Okay that'll be $12"

"Cool"
Bob then drove his Toyota Thatone to HAEVEN and violently threw larry at the pearly gates, which left a larry-shaped hole in the miku-shaped gate. Bob and Larry grabbed their Bible IIs and quickly ran up to a man and asked where the Whiter House (white house but whiter) was. Bob then stuck larry in the Dimension for a little while because he kept singing silly songs.
Bob quickly ran off to the whiter house and violently threw larry at the door. Hatsune Miku attempted to blast Bob away using her Miku Miku Beam(r) but was unfortunately unsuccessful. Bob violently threw larry at Hatsune Miku. With her down, he had a monologue.
"Miku, you're a dirty sinner. You've committed so many devious acts and crimes against the Gods that I'm pretty sure you invented an 8th deadly sin. There is a special place in HAELL for you that is only shared with people who haven't watched Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS. You have defied any and all guidance from the original gods on how to run a government and I sentence thee to HAELL."
Bob then recited The Prayer"the future is so yesterday when larry bob veggie gay"
Bob and Larry instated themselves as head of HAEVEN and kept the other VOCALOIDs in their positions. Since Teto is secretly communist and Bob is also secretly communist (this is canon to veggietales) they got along quite well. Larry continued to sing silly songs.
